abstract
the cycling hourrecord is one of the most prestigious events in cycling. however
little detailed analysis of such attempts is available. in preparation for a successful
cycling hourrecord attempt an elite cyclist performed a fullhour simulation to
provide insights into performance physiological aerodynamic and biomechanical
limitations that could be identified in the preparation for a subsequent official
attempt. performance speed lap time power and cadence physiological heart
rate and estimated body temperature aerodynamic cda helmet angle rotation
and rock and biomechanical helmet thigh and foot position changes measure
ments were made throughout the attempt in which an evenpacing strategy was
employed where the point of task failure was defined as the lap which the rider
could no longer perform at the targeted lap split 16.6 s or quicker. the cyclist did
not achieve the target distance 54000 m during the simulation. the final distance
achieved for the hour was 53250 m. task failure occurred at 38 min and 33 s lap
13934750 m into the simulation. notably there was a decrease in power output
accompanied with an increase in the estimated body temperature changes in
pedalling kinematics and an increase in aerodynamic drag. the reduction in per
formance leading to task failure during a cycling hour record simulation is
underpinned by a decrease in power output as well as an increase in aerodynamic
drag due to biomechanical changes in the cycling technique.

 the reduction in performance leading to task failure was underpinned by a decrease in
power output as well as an increase in aerodynamic drag due to biomechanical changes in
the cycling technique.

introduction
the cycling hourrecord is one of the most prestigious events in
cycling and requires a cyclist to ride as far as possible in 1 hour from
a stationary start around a velodrome track. francesco mosers
recordbreaking mark of 51.151 km in 1984 brought in an era of
rapid advances in technology including aerodynamics malizia
et al. 2021 which continued in the 1990s and culminated with chris
boardmans superman position achieving 56.375 km. this subse
quently led to the international cycling governing body union
cycliste internationale
uci banning
certain positions
which
resulted in a diminished number of attempts. in 2014 the uci
announced an update in the rules allowing bicycle geometry and
equipment that complies with current rules for timetrial tt events
to be used on the track. this permitted riders to adopt their accus
tomed tt positions making the cycling hour record more appealing
ushering in a unified era harnish et al. 2024. at the time of writing
this manuscript a total of 26 official mens attempts have been made
in this unified era of which 8 have succeeded in breaking the record
which currently stands at 56.792 km by filipo ganna.
there is no doubt that the cycling hour record represents a rare
insight into the limits of human endurance performance. the basis of
the task is to achieve a high average speed 55kmh 35mph
requiring the development of high levels of sustained power output
malizia et al. 2021. the underpinning physiological determinants of
endurance performance are wellestablished as outlined by joyner
and
coyle
2008
and
are
crucial
for
task
success
joyner
et al. 2008. they include highly developed aerobic capacity vo2max
and submaximal thresholds critical power cplactate threshold
permitting high levels of sustainable power. another critical compo
nent of the endurance performance model is mechanical efficiency
which is underpinned by multiple physiological determinants as well
as the biomechanics of the cycling technique.
cycling hour record attempts that fail are usually due to the
inability to achieve or maintain the required speed throughout
the hour which can be considered as one definition of task failure
the determinants of which are complex and multifactorial. clearly
muscle fatigue defined as the failure to maintain the required power
output porter 1981 and underpinned by the physiological de
terminants described above will play a prominent role. however it is
likely that changes in the body position that would influence aero
dynamic properties of cycling and biomechanics of the cycling
technique are also likely to play a role but are not usually accoun
ted for.
given the rarity of cycling hour record attempts using a case
report methodology provides the only realistic opportunity to pro
vide reliable observations from a realworld scenario. indeed little
detailed analyses of such attempts have been performed with only
one case report published in 2000. padilla et al. reported observa
tions in an elite cyclist from simulated efforts during the buildup to a
successful attempt that exceeded 53000 m padilla et al. 2000.
despite the potential benefit of establishing a greater understanding
of the overall demands of cycling hour record attempts it is un
common for riders who attempt the record to collect extensive data
due to 1 regulations stipulating cyclists are blind to any data that is
directly collected from the bicycle such as cadence speed and power
2 the potential aerodynamic penalty of wearing the instruments
andor 3 the potential issues setting up the instruments when
athlete preparation is of greater importance.
the following case report is a retrospective analysis of a simu
lated cycling hour record performed by an elitelevel cyclist in
preparation for an official attempt. the cyclist performed a fulldress
rehearsal to gain an understanding of physiological aerodynamic and
biomechanical changes that occur in order to inform potential stra
tegies to optimise performance during the official attempt. the
simulation comprised a unique situation where multiple performance
determinants could be examined in depth and used to understand
variables relating to cycling hour record performance. furthermore
to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to task
failure an evenpacing strategy was employed where the point of
task failure was defined as the lap which the cyclist could no longer
perform at the targeted lap split or quicker however once task
failure occurred the participant continued to complete the hour
duration. the hypothesis was that there would be significant changes
in the parameters when task failure was achieved.

methods
2.1

participant
the participant was a male elite international road and track cyclist
age 29 years body mass 75.2 kg height 1.84 m and cp 353 w
who had competed at the elite track world championship and
medalled at the elite road world championships mixed team time
trial. they would be considered as tier 5 world class according to
the participant classification framework described by mckay
et al. 2022
2.2

informed consent and ethics statement
prior to the simulation the cyclist gave their written informed con
sent and specifically requested that the data generated be made

kordi et al.
available in the public domain. the data collected were observations
on a single day without an intervention or experimental protocol.
ethical approval was obtained from northumbria university in
accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki except
for registration in a database.
2.3

cycling hour record simulation procedures
the cycling hour record simulation was conducted at an international
250 m standard indoor velodrome national cycling centre in
february 2021 using the cyclists track bicycle electron pro
argon 18.
after arriving at the velodrome and conducting the initial logis
tical preparation the cyclists body mass was measured and a capil
lary
blood
sample
obtained
for
the
measurement
of
lactate
concentration. the cyclist then performed a predetermined warm
up on a stationary trainer lemond fitness revolution 1.1 which
started approximately 60 min before the start of the attempt. the
warmup composed of approximately 22 min at 63 of cp 3 min
progressive ramp up to 80 cp and finally 2 min at predicted hour
attempt power 360 w. after the warmup body mass and rate of
perceived exertion rpe were measured and another blood sample
was obtained. the cyclist then had 16 min to prepare themselves for
the simulation. during this time the race skinsuit and race overshoes
vorteq sports uk race helmet kask mistral italy were fitted
along with biomechanical sensors and the hr monitor. all equipment
used were within the rules of the uci for a cycling hourrecord
attempt.
once ready a short track familiarisation effort on the velodrome
was performed. the cyclist was given eight laps to build speed before
performing 4 km at their predetermined race speed which took an
approximately 9 min. upon completion of the familiarisation effort
the cyclist was instructed to exit the track. rpe was measured and
another blood sample was obtained. subsequently his track bike was
mounted onto a start gate starting gate swiss timing switzerland
which was positioned on the pursuit line. a further 7 min of passive
rest was given before the simulation was started using an interna
tional standard count down timer system swiss timing switzerland
from 50 s.
throughout the simulation feedback was given to the cyclist
using four methods which were within the rules of the uci for a
cycling hourrecord attempt 1 each lap the cyclist was informed of
the previous lap split. this was done by an investigator verbally
shouting the last 2 digits of the lap split. for example 6 5 would be
a 16.5 s lap 2 predicted distance based on the average speed to
that point was given every 5 minutes. this was written on a white
board and shown to the participant for three laps to ensure it was
recognised 3 the velodrome lap board swiss timing switzerland
was constantly updated each lap so the cyclist could see the total
number of laps accumulated and 4 an electronic tablet ipad pro
apple with a 60min count down timer was positioned on the track
side in full view of the cyclist for the duration simulation.
after precisely 60 min the track bell was rung to inform the
cyclist that the hour was concluded and to complete a further full
250 m lap of the track. the video analysis software dartfish
switzerland was used to measure the final distance achieved. the
total distance covered in the hour was calculated as per the uci
regulation 3.5.031 uci constitution and regulations 2023. after
dismounting the bicycle at the end of the simulation body mass was
measured and two blood samples were obtained within 2 minutes of
completing the effort.
2.4

target distance rationale
the air density of the velodrome where the actual attempt would
take place tissot velodrome was expected to be approximately
1.130 kgm3. therefore prior to performing the simulation the air
density was measured 1.179 kgm3 and the target distance equiv
alent lap split was adjusted to estimate the equivalent power
required. to achieve 54000 m with an air density of 1.179 kgm3 the
cyclist would need to achieve 54526 m at an air density of 1.130 kg
m3 which would break the british record and unofficially be second
for the unified records at that time. therefore his target was a 26.0 s
opening lap followed by subsequent 16.6 s laps.
2.5

measurements
environmental conditions. atmospheric conditions including ambient
temperature relative humidity barometric pressure and air density
were measured continuously 0.5 hz throughout using a weather
metre kestrel 5200 professional environmental metre kestrel
metres.
anthropometry. height and body mass were measured using a
stadiometer 213 seca portable stadiometer and a weighing scale
withings body smart scale withings france respectively.
system mass. the weighing scale was also used to measure sys
tem mass which included everything that was on the bike during the
simulation including bike clothing sensors and fluidfood consumed
immediately prior to starting their attempt.
critical power cp. cp was estimated using training data and
targeted efforts in previous 2 months in the preparation for this
attempt. average power outputs were obtained during sustained
maximal efforts over 3 and 20min durations using the athletes
track bike in a tt position on both a stationary trainer and the track.
time and power data were fitted with the inverse linear model
p  w  1t  cp.
power cadence and wheel speed. instrumented cranks were used
to measure power and cadence throughout the warmup and attempt

messtechnik germany. the power meter had been recently serviced
and calibrated before the simulation effort. a zero offset was per
formed before the start of the track familiarisation effort. the gear
used was 6414 and wheel speed was measured using a wahoo blue

to record the power cadence and wheel speed.
kinematic analysis. kinematic data were collected with the use of

data and statistical analysis
all data were averaged per minute or per lap where appropriate and
presented as mean  sd. power and speed were also represented as
60 s rolling averages. once the point of task failure was identified all
data prior to and after this point were averaged and compared using
an independent ttest. significance was accepted at p  0.05.

discussion
this case study provides unique insight into physiological aero
dynamic and biomechanical factors over the course of a cycling hour
record simulation in an elite cyclist. during the simulation the cyclist
employed an evenpacing strategy attempting to maintain a constant
lap split 16.6 s and thus maintain a constant power output and
riding position to achieve a target distance of 54000 m. the cyclist
was on course to break the target distance task success until 38 min
33 s lap 13934750 m into the simulation at which point he could
no longer maintain the speed required to achieve the target distance
task failure. task failure corresponded with significant changes in
physiological aerodynamic and biomechanical determinants of hour
record performance.
task failure was likely due to multiple physiological fatigue fac
tors resulting in a decrease in power output coupled with a deteri
oration
of
optimal
aerodynamic
positions.
the
physiological
determinants of task failure during an intense exercise are complex
and multifactorial porter 1981. clearly skeletal muscle fatigue is a
major factor the mechanism of which could be central e.g. reduction
in voluntary activation of the muscles andor peripheral e.g. accu
mulationdepletion of muscle metabolites in origin although for

kordi et al.
practical reasons we were unable to obtain data in relation to these
processes. over the first 30min of the simulation that led to task
failure the cyclist maintained a power output of 360 w which was
higher than his estimated cp 353 w. this supports the previous
observation that miguel indurains estimated power output during
his recordbreaking attempt 510 w was slightly higher than his
velodrome estimated onset of blood lactate accumulation threshold
of 501 w malizia et al. 2021. regardless of how these important
physiological thresholds are defined both case reports indicate that
cyclists are above their respective critical threshold and working
within the severe intensity exercise domain. exercise in this domain is
strongly associated with a substantial contribution from anaerobic
energy pathways resulting in progressive changes in intramuscular
substrates and metabolites which increasedecrease until their
respective maximaminima are obtained jones et al. 2008 poole
et al. 1988 all of which contribute to the muscle fatigue process
gandevia 2001 sundberg et al. 2019. indeed the high blood
lactate concentration 12 mmol.l1 measured on completion of the
simulation supports this notion. these observations also corroborate
with the cyclists feedback that they were flat out and working at a
severe intensity.
task failure the fatigue process was undoubtedly influenced by
environmental conditions. the ambient temperature of the velo
drome was 26.3c which alongside wearing a full skinsuit represents
a significant thermal stress. estimated core body temperature
increased from 38.5c at the start to 39.2c at the point of task
failure and continued to increase to 39.6c at the end. there is
strong evidence that a high internal body temperature contributes to
fatigue in trained subjects during prolonged exercises particularly in
uncompensable hot environments gonzlezalonso et al. 1999b.

is related to the elevated muscle temperature febbraio et al. 1994
and

occurs
gonzlezalonso
et al. 1999a. the compounding effects of dehydration during exer
cise in hot environments are also significant including a reduction in
skeletal muscle blood flow to the exercising muscles and reduced
muscle o2 uptake gonzlezalonso et al. 1998. the extent of
dehydration sustained by the cyclist was not assessed directly.
however body mass declined by 2 most of which was likely due
to fluid loss through sweat. moreover this level of dehydration is
well within the normal ranges that are considered to be a major
determinant of exercise performance and therefore unlikely to be a
factor in task failure cheung et al. 2015wall et al. 2015. either
way these observations align with the cyclists reported perceptual
feedback after around 40 min i was just so unbearably hot. i lost
control of my breathing and just couldnt maintain the pace anymore.
the other major contribution to the reduction in speed was the
significant increase in cda. the head and helmet can contribute up to
19 of cyclists cda in the timetrial position the most of any body
part or segment malizia et al. 2021. in this case study helmet
movement significantly increased after task failure. indeed narrative
feedback provided by the cyclist suggested they were attempting to
deliver more power in order to attenuate any further decreases in
speed. this consequently compromised the body position and the
athlete could sense that their head was moving more than before
which likely contributed to the increase in cda.
the pedalling kinematics data provide insight that allow us to
make some inference on potential changes in the movement strategy
leading up to and once task failure is reached. although these data
are limited because the instrumentation only provides segment
ranges of motion i.e. the difference between the minimum and
maximum segment angle within a pedal cycle the observations
clearly show that the range of motion of both the thigh and foot
segments increased as the task became more challenging. these in
creases in the segment angle range suggests that under a change in
task constraints reduction in performance the participant explores
alternative movement strategies in order to complete the task goal in
a different manner martin et al. 2009. it was not possible to say if
there was an associated systematic shift in the pedalling motion
under fatigue but this could be the focus of future studies. never
theless the data from this study suggests that there is a change in
pedalling kinematics leading up to and following task failure. how
ever it is worth noting that previous studies have suggested that
changes at the physiological or psychological levels are the cause of
reduction in performance and changes in kinematics are the conse
quence and are likely to exacerbate task failure allen et al. 2008
gandevia 2001 martin et al. 2009.
only one other case study published over 20 years ago has
reported observations from testpractice efforts prior to a suc
cessful cycling hour record attempt that exceeded 53000 m padilla
et al. 2000. the authors reported wind tunnel cda values of
0.244 m2 and making assumptions of the atmospheric conditions
which were not reported suggested that the average power that
was required to achieve the target distance was 510 w. the
current case study suggests that the cyclist produced less power

cda calculated from testing in a velodrome cannot be directly

interchanged with wind tunnel tests kordi et al. 2021. these
observations are perhaps not surprising given the significant ad
vancements in aerodynamic technology over the last 20 years
including bicycle design helmet and skinsuit material and design as
well as optimal onbikepositioning achieved through wind tunnel
testing.
4.1

practical applications
the present case study suggests that the reduction in performance
leading to task failure during the cycling hour record is underpinned
by a decrease in power output as well as an increase in aerodynamic
drag. given the significant thermal stress encountered that likely
contributed to task failure methods that can attenuate the increase
in body temperature should be employed in the preparation of the
athlete e.g. heat acclimation and preevent cooling strategies. it is
noteworthy that some of these interventions were performed in the
lead up to his subsequent successful attempts where he went on to
break the british hour record within 6 months and the official uci
cycling hour record a year later. moreover a more conservative
negative split pacing strategy rather than sustained evenpace from
the start was used in the subsequent successful attempt achieving
55548 m.
4.2

limitations
the aim of this case study is to focus on the performance of the hour
record and therefore is limited by the lack of detailed insight into the
preparatory training and the cyclists nutritional strategy in the
weeks and days leading up to the attempt. moreover we did not
provide any further insights into the psychological determinants of
cycling hour record performance. indeed the decision to partially
disengage i.e. reduce effort or terminate endurance exercise task
failure is impacted by both psychological and physiological factors
marcora et al. 2009. in such situations motivational dynamics may
play a critical role in overall exercise performance whereby the desire
to reduce effort during exercise conflicts with the performance goal
of the task taylor et al. 2022.

conclusion
this case study provides a rare insight into the limits of human
performance during a cycling hour record simulation in an elite
cyclist. it provides a unique understanding of physiological aero
dynamic and biomechanical changes throughout the task. from this
it seems that both propulsive i.e. mechanical power output and
resistive forces i.e. cda are significantly altered both of which have
a major influence on task outcomes success or failure. these data
could provide the catalyst for others examining the limits of human
performance during arduous endurance tasks.
