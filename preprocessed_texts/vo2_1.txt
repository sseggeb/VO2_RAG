abstract
endurance exercise training studies frequently show modest changes in vo2max with training and very limited responses in
some subjects. by contrast studies using interval training it or combined it and continuous training ct have reported
mean increases in vo2max of up to 1.0 l? min21. this raises questions about the role of exercise intensity and the
trainability of vo2max. to address this topic we analyzed it and itct studies published in english from 19652012.
inclusion criteria were 13 healthy sedentaryrecreationally active humans 45 yrs old 2 training duration 613 weeks
3 3 daysweek 4 10 minutes of high intensity work 5 11 workrest ratio and 6 results reported as mean 6 sd or
se ranges of change or individual data. due to heterogeneity i2 value of 70 statistical synthesis of the data used a random
effects model. the summary statistic of interest was the change in vo2max. a total of 334 subjects 120 women from 37
studies were identified. participants were grouped into 40 distinct training groups so the unit of analysis was 40 rather than
37. an increase in vo2max of 0.51 l?min21 95 ci 0.43 to 0.60 l? min21 was observed. a subset of 9 studies with 72
subjects that featured longer intervals showed even larger 0.80.9 l? min21 changes in vo2max with evidence of a
marked response in all subjects. these results suggest that ideas about trainability and vo2max should be further evaluated
with standardized it or itct training programs.

introduction
the benefits of an active lifestyle are well documented 13.
many of these benefits are also associated with higher levels of
cardiorespiratory fitness vo2max which may exert protective
effects that are independent of traditional risk factors 34.
additionally for individuals with low physical fitness even modest
improvements in fitness can have substantial health benefits.
however some individuals may have a limited ability to increase
their cardiorespiratory fitness trainability in response to endur-
ance exercise training 56.
a key study advancing the idea that some humans have limited
trainability comes from bouchard et al. studied 483 sedentary
white adults from 99 nuclear families who completed a standard-
ized 20-wk endurance training program 56. the subjects trained
three times per week on a treadmill. initially they trained at a
heart rate that correlated to 55 of their baseline vo2max for
30 minutes per session. every two weeks the intensity and duration
of the exercise was progressively increased until each subject was
training for 50 minutes at a heart rate associated with 75 of their
baseline vo2max. this level of intensity and duration was reached
by the 14th week of training and maintained until the conclusion
of the study. using this approach they found a mean increase in
vo2max of 0.4 l? min21 with a sd of.0.2 lmin.
additionally 7 of subjects showed a gain of 0.1 l? min21 or
less while 8 of subjects improved by 0.7 l? min21 or more.
based on this distribution of vo2max responses it appears that
the trainability of at least some subjects is low or non-existent
with little or no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness in spite of
20 weeks of structured exercise training 56. these observations
are in contrast to reports from smaller studies that have used either
interval training it or interval training in combination with
continuous training ct and shown more robust increases in
vo2max with at least some evidence of marked responses in all
subjects 715.
in this context we sought to explore the hypothesis that all
subjects can show marked improvements in vo2max if training
programs that include periods of high intensity 90 of
vo2max exercise are used. a fundamental rationale underpin-
ning our analysis is that the biology of vo2max trainability needs
to be evaluated using regimens designed to maximize physiological
adaptations. to test this hypothesis we evaluated the changes in
vo2max in response to interval training it or combined it and
continuous training ct reported in 37 studies 743. we also
sought to gain insight into the idea that shorter periods of it might
be either superior or more time efficient at generating increases in
vo2max in comparison to traditional continuous training.

methods
study eligibility criteria and literature search
a search of pubmed was developed and conducted by a
reference librarian looking for english language studies occurring
between the years of 19682010 using the following search terms
interval training vo2max interval exercise  highlow intensity
maximum o2 maximummaximal vo2 maximal oxygen con-
sumption peak oxygen uptake maximal aerobic capacity and the
following limits humans english. the primary author of each
eligible study was searched for in pubmed using the authors name
and the search term exercise. searches were also run on other
authors known by the investigators to have published papers that
used a combination of interval and continuous training. the
