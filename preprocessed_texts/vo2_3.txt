is study aimed to evaluate systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have examined the eect of exercise training on vo2max
in healthy individuals at dierent intensities. five databases were searched ebscohost medlinepubmed sportdiscus web
of science and google scholar. eligibility criteria for selecting reviews included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of healthy
adults that examined the eect of lower intensity training lit andor high intensity training hit on vo2max. eleven reviews
met the eligibility criteria. all reviews were of moderate-to-very strong methodological quality. e included reviews reported data
from 179 primary studies with an average of 23  10 studies per review. all reviews included in this overview showed that exercise
training robustly increased vo2max at all intensities. ree meta-analyses that compared lit versus hit protocols on vo2max
reported smallmoderate benecial eects for hit over lit however the benecial eects of hit on vo2max appear to be
moderated by training variables other than intensity e.g. training impulse interval length training volume and duration and
participants baseline characteristics e.g. age and tness levels. overall evidence from this overview suggests that the apparent
dierences between lit and hit protocols on vo2max were either small trivial or inconclusive with several methodological
considerations required to standardise research designs and draw denitive conclusions.
1. introduction
vo2max is the gold standard measure of cardiorespiratory
tness 1 2 and a strong predictor of cardiovascular health
morbidity and all-cause mortality 35. erefore an
improvement in vo2max i.e. the functional limit of the
cardiorespiratory system can reduce the risk of cardio-
vascular disease and mortalityeven when other risk factors
are present e.g. ageing hypertension diabetes smoking
and obesity 4 6. exercise training is an eective means of
increasing vo2max 1 2. erefore clear recommenda-
tions for exercise intensity are required to facilitate optimal
and ecient improvements in cardiorespiratory tness.
e prescription of training intensity falls into two
broad
categories lower-intensity
training
lit
and
higher-intensity training hit. a standardised approach
to the categorisation of intensity has been frequently
established e.g. lit refers to exercise bouts 80
vo2max whereas hit refers to exercise bouts 80
vo2max 7. and within these categories three exercise
modalities are commonly prescribed within the literature
1 moderate-intensity continuous training mict 2
high-intensity interval training hiit and 3 sprint in-
terval training sit. mict usually refers to training
programmes consisting of extended duration continuous
exercise at moderate intensities e.g. 5080 vo2max
8 9. hiit is a form of interval training which refers to
intermittent exercise that involves alternating higher in-
tensity with lower intensity 10 with high intensity e.g.
80170 vo2max bouts of exercise between 30 seconds

and 4 minutes 11. sit is another form of interval training
which consists of maximal intensity e.g. maximal exer-
tion 170 vo2max but shorter durations of up to 30
seconds 12 13. both lit i.e. mict and hit i.e. hiit
and sit protocols have been shown to signicantly im-
prove vo2max in most populations e.g. young elderly
activeathletic and sedentary 14 15 however which or
if any exercise training intensity is most eective at in-
creasing vo2max remains unclear.
ere are several systematic reviews and meta-analyses
available in the existing literature examining the eect of
exercise training on vo2max. however very little is known
about the overlap of the primary studies included in these
systematic reviews andor meta-analyses. hence the dif-
ferent methodologies employed within each systematic re-
viewmeta-analysis will inuence results e.g. intensity
standardisation and prescription eligibility criteria data
analysis etc. making it dicult to draw denitive con-
clusions from any single review. erefore the primary aim
of this paper was to perform an overview of systematic
reviews and meta-analyses that have examined the eect of
exercise training on vo2max at dierent intensities in
healthynonclinical populations. in addition to an overview
of the available evidence our secondary aim was to provide
practical applications based on ndings and make key
suggestions for future research for establishing evidence-
based recommendations on exercise training intensity. in
this regard an overview of systematic reviews and meta-
analyses provides an opportunity to map and summarise the
evidence to date highlight limitations in the extant litera-
ture absence of evidence and identify the key variables that
may inuence the eects of exercise training intensity of
vo2max.
2. methods
2.1. search strategy. electronic database searches were
performed
through
ebscohost
medline
pubmed
sportdiscus web of science and google scholar using all
available records up to 30 july 2021. e literature search
quality assessment and data extraction were conducted
independently by two authors ec and cp and any dis-
crepancies were resolved following discussion with a third
author rd. a combination of search terms was used
table 1.
2.2. study criteria. is review had a series of inclusion and
exclusion criteria which were limited to systematic reviews
andor meta-analyses articles. e inclusion criteria were 1
exercisetraining interventions 2 randomised and non-
randomised controlled trials with interventions on healthy
adults 3 exercise intensity groups 4 control groups
5 written in english only and 6 distinction of data for
extraction between experimental groups. e exclusion
criteria were 1 no measure of vo2max 2 cross-sectional
study design 3 patient groups 4 strength training 5
concurrent training 6 nutritional interventions and 7
masters paraplegic andor athletes with clinical conditions.
2.3. selection of systematic reviews andor meta-analyses.
systematic reviews and meta-analyses were selected using
the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and
meta-analyses prisma guidelines figure 1 16. e
search process included a hierarchy of assessment whereby
papers were rst assessed by journal title and duplicates
removed second by abstract and third by full-article review
when the journal article was either included or excluded
based on the eligibility criteria.
2.4. summary measures. data were extracted from sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses under two key areas
background information and training interventions with
vo2max as the outcome measure. background information
included 1 type of reviewanalysis e.g. systematic review
meta-analysis and metaregression 2 the number of
studies included in each review 3 training intensity groups
i.e. control mict hiit and sit which fall under the
umbrella terms of litor hit resp. 4 sample size in each
training group and 5 baseline characteristics e.g. sex age
and training status. e following training intervention
information was also extracted 1 modality of exercise e.g.
running cycling etc. 2 duration of the intervention 3
frequency of training weekly 4 exercise intensity i.e. 
max and 5 change in vo2max or prepost-training re-
sults. for accuracy of interpretation all intensity descriptors
i.e. numerical and categorical were extracted from their
original reviews ad verbatim and were not recategorised
within the results section of this current paper.
2.5. study quality assessment. a measurement tool for the
assessment of multiple systematic reviews amstar
checklist was used to rate the quality of the literature 17.
e tool consists of 11 items and has good face and content
validity for measuring the methodological quality of sys-
tematic reviews 17. e total quality score for each in-
cluded review ranged from 0 to 11. e quality of the review
was labelled as either weak score range 03 moderate
score range 47 or strong score range 811.
if primary studies are included in more than one review this
can lead to bias pseudoreplication in the interpretation of the
results. a citation matrix of the primary studies was constructed
to assess the degree of overlap between the systematic reviews
meta-analyses included in the overview. e degree of overlap
was assessed by the percentage of primary studies included in 1
systematic reviewmeta-analysis and the correct covered area
ccanrr  cr1 where n is the total number of studies
including

c number

reviews
r number of unique studies indicating slight 0 to 5

together the eleven included reviews covered a total of 179
primary studies at 23  10 range 9 to 41 studies per review.
forty-nine 27 of the primary studies were included in
two or more reviews. e cca was 4.7 indicating a
slight degree of overlap between systematic reviewmeta-
analyses.

ned as a nonexercise control group con 19 22 or an
exercising control group ex-con 14 26 which nomi-
nally diered from mict but was approximately the same
intensity andor a mict 14 15 19 23 24 27 group with
hiit 14 2125 or sit 15 26 27 accompanying the ex-
con or con groups. e reviews in some instances only
reported the total sample size 21 24 25 with other reviews
including the breakdown of participants across the training
groups. all reviews included both male and female partic-
ipants however it was evident that there was a greater
number of male participants 68 male vs. 27 female

i.e. mict hiit and sit and accompanied by the number of
studies and range of intensities prescribed. it is important to
note that the categorisation of intensity within hit groups
diers and is not in line with previously standardised categories
25. for example montero et al. 21 classify hit at vo2max
between 60 and 80. however montero et al. 24 in a younger
population 2228 years prescribed hitas a vo2max between
60 and 95. additionally it is important to note that denitions
of variables of power output dier between reviews and in some
instances dierent denitions equate to the same prescription
measure. for example pmax 14 wrmax 19 wattmax
21 24 and ppo 20 26 27 provide similar measures of
power output but use dierent terminology. erefore within
tables 2 and 3 intensities were categorised in accordance with
the original reviews and not recategorised however these in-
tensity variations were taken into consideration for the purpose
of the discussion section. finally vo2max as an outcome
measure was either reported as ml.kg.min1 l.min1 or 
change in vo2max.
3.3. exercise outcome. all reviews included in this overview
showed that exercise training increased vo2max table 3.
reviews that used a nonexercise control comparator showed a
signicant improvement in vo2max following lit i.e. mict
14 19 and hit i.e. hiit 14 20 22 25 and sit 20 26
27. six meta-analyses directly compared hit and lit mo-
dalities 14 20 22 23 26 which allowed for a meta-analytical
comparison between training intensity groups. of these three
20 23 27 reported smallmoderate benecial eects for hit
on vo2max over lit 20 23 but had a high degree of overlap
between primary studies cca 11. however it is impor-
tant to highlight some discrepancies withinbetween the reviews
included in this overview which resulted in exclusion from the
intensity comparison. for example montero et al. 21 24
included both a hiit hit group and an mict lit group
group however the intensities prescribed for hiit were low
e.g. 6095 vo2max compared to other reviews included in
this overview. ese reviews could not be considered for further
analyses as they did not have a distinctive hitgroup. erefore
the ndings are principally here limited to a young healthy
participants.

studies. however further investigation shows the limitation
of current systematic reviews andor meta-analyses with an
average of only 23  10 studies per review which highlights
the need for this current overview. e ndings of this
overview show that lit and hit are both eective at in-
creasing vo2max in both young and old healthy and
sedentary adults however some methodological consid-
erations require attention on the interpretation of these
ndings. evidence from the meta-analyses that directly
compared lit versus hit protocols on vo2max was os-
tensibly reported as either trivial or inconclusive. ree out
of the six included meta-analyses reported smallmoderate
benecial eects of hit over lit   0.05 20 23 27.
however two of these reviews reported substantial het-
erogeneity i20.75 28 small-study bias p  0.10 29 a
relatively small pooled sample size i.e. 1000 participants
had a high degree of overlap cca  11 and reported
several moderators e.g. baseline tness levels age hit
variables e.g. volume frequency and duration which
likely aected results. all three reviews identied that
compared to lit hitgenerally elicited a greater increase in
vo2max in older and less t populations andor when long-
interval 2 to 4 minutes of workbout high-volume 15-
minute worksession and moderatelong-duration hit
protocols 4 weeks were prescribed 20 23 27. fur-
thermore several primary studies within these reviews
concluded that hit had greater benecial eects for older
participants whereas lit showed greater eects for par-
ticipants with lower baseline tness 19 21 24. erefore it
is dicult to conduct a crude comparisons between litand
hit where a more nuanced approach is required i.e. not all
populations respond the same nor are all hit protocols
consistent therefore giving disparate responses because of
other training parameters rather than intensity per se.
4.2. systematic review findings. in healthy older partici-
pants montero et al. 21 reported an increase in vo2max
following a lit intervention smd  0.79 ci  0.41 to 1.17
with the hit intervention prescribed at 6080 vo2max
also eliciting an improvement in vo2max smd  0.95
ci  0.64 to 1.25. analysis revealed that none of the
assessed potential cofactors i.e. gender training charac-
teristics and methodological quality moderated the im-
provement in vo2max. furthermore montero et al. 24
reported similar results in a younger population but found
that training interventions using cycling ergometer
showed a greater increase in vo2max compared with
studies
that
undertook
lit
running
treadmill
smd  1.06 vs. 0.43. as expected huang et al. 19
showed that older sedentary individuals who performed
lit 5560 vo2max for 3035 minutes per session
three times per week for 1620 weeks could improve their
vo2max by approximately 3.8 ml kg.min1 16 im-
provement. moreover recent big data research on real-
world running activities of 14000 individuals with 1.6
million exercise sessions and a total distance of 20 million
km found that faster runners partake in greater volumes of
lit than slower runners which was associated with better
performance during high-intensity exercise 30.
research has shown that hit increases vo2max in
healthy adults 24. scribbans et al. 22 found that hit
8092.5 vo2max was a powerful method for eliciting
improvements in vo2max 0.26  0.10 l.min1 es  0.68.
weston et al. 14 included a cohort of both healthy and
sedentary participants reporting moderate improvements in
vo2max for both active nonathletic 6.2  3.1 and sed-
entary men 10  5.1 as well as active nonathletic
3.6  4.3 and sedentary women 7.3  4.8 when
compared to a control group 1.2  2.0. wen et al. 20
found that the degree of change in vo2max induced by hit
varied by population with greater improvements seen from
a healthy nonathletic population compared to an athletic
population. although all hitprotocols only evoked a small
moderate increase in vo2max over lit programmes 27
long-interval 2 min smd  1.07 ci  0.62 1.52 high-
volume 15 min smd  1.04 ci  0.54 1.54 and
moderate-to-long duration 412 weeks smd  0.77
ci  0.08 1.61 hit programmes evoked a greater in-
crease in vo2max 20 which highlights that a more nu-
anced approach is required in view of other training
variables alongside intensity during program design. finally
sloth et al. found that 28 weeks of hit performed 23
times a week showed vo2max improvements smd  0.63
ci  0.39 to 0.87 for both sedentary and healthy participants
15. however when compared to lit gist et al. 26 found
small eects between hitand lit smd  0.04 ci  -0.17 to
0.24. ese ndings provide evidence in support of hit but
as their meta-analysis concluded the dierence in the in-
crease between hitand litwas either trivial or inconclusive
in healthy participants.
4.3. limitations and future research considerations. it is
evident that both lit and hit modalities carry their own
limitations. scribbans et al. 22 noted that a lack of an exercise

intensity eect was specically related to lit interventions
during short-term studies that were not comparable to hit
interventions. erefore work-matched i.e. per session and
over the total training period training loads are required to
make accurate comparisons between hit and lit interven-
tions 22. and the use of training impulse trimp i.e.
usually the product of training intensity and time may
provide greater insight into the relative ecacy of litand hit
interventions 30. is also highlights the need for stand-
ardisation of training with large variation in control of the
independent variable i.e. intensity reported between studies.
it was noted that several of the reviews in this overview
prescribed hit interventions that could have been reclas-
sied as lit 21 24. furthermore with reference to training
intensity standardisation is required for some of the other
training variables that are sometimes inextricably linked to
training intensity e.g. frequency volume and duration. gist
et al. 26 stated that the duration of training interventions in
most sit studies was 6 weeks questioning the long-term
improvements and adaptations within these studies.
broader limitations exist around sample population
study design and sample size. whilst some reviews reported
heterogeneity among their included studies 20 others only
included studies of young healthy sedentary or recreationally
active adults 14 15 22 or older populations 19 21. as
noted previously there are a greater number of males across
the 11 included reviews. removing any potential bias
through rcts is an important consideration. scribbans et al.
22 reported that none of their included studies applied
rcts sloth et al. 15 reported only four studies that applied
rcts design and gist et al. 26 reported that the majority of
included studies were rcts. finally smallunderpowered
sample sizes are a re-occurring problem as recruitment
adherence and commitment are dicult. montero et al. 21
stated that the majority of ndings were derived from a
relatively small number of studies reporting a lack of sta-
tistical power 15 and potential publication bias in sample
sizes of between eight and ten participants with the ag-
gregation of data suggesting publication bias is likely 20.
erefore our overview begins to overcome these issues and
highlights the need for carefully controlled research designs.
other specic considerations need to be considered such
as outdated technology and possibly how less reliable
methods for measuring vo2max might aect the validity and
reliability of results from early studies 19. hitwarrants high
levels of motivation and this may present as an issue to long-
term adherence 14. finally the extraction of relative values
ml.kg.min1 rather than absolute values l.min1 of
vo2max may magnify the training eect due to a possible
decrease of body mass during the training intervention 20.
ese considerations should provide future researchers with
some guidance around the interpretation of previously
published research and future aggregation of these ndings.
5. perspective
e ndings of this review show that both lit and hit are
eective at improving vo2max and overlap analysis between
reviews highlights the need for such an approach to
synthesising the literature. evidence from meta-analyses that
compared lit versus hit protocols on vo2max reported
either small trivial or inconclusive eects between training
groups. ree reviews reported that hit has potentially
greater benecial eects for older andor less t participants
versus lit. interestingly smaller eects were seen for longer
hit intervals and may suggest the importance of exercise
intensity even between dierent hit modalities e.g. sit
and hiit. finally several methodological considerations
are highlighted in this overview such as the sample pop-
ulation research design sample size and intervention du-
ration. other specic considerations include technology
used to control monitor and administer the exercise in-
tensity control of other extraneous training parameters
e.g. work trimp to allow accurate comparisons to be
made dierent exercise intensities and standardised no-
menclature around training intensity guidelines and cate-
gorisation in research and practice.
