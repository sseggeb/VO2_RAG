background this study investigated the periodization of elite swimmers training over
the 25 weeks preceding the major competition of the season.
methods we conducted a retrospective observational study of elite male n  60
and female n  67 swimmers 46 sprint 81 middledistance over 20 competitive
seasons 19922012. the following variables were monitored training corresponding
to blood lactate 2 mmoll1 2 to 4 mmoll1 46 mmoll1 6 mmoll1 and
maximal swimming speed general conditioning and maximal strength training hours
total training load ttl and the mean normalized volumes for both inwater and dryland
workouts. latent class mixed modeling was used to identify various ttl pattern groups.
the associations between pattern groups and sex age competition event olympic
quadrennial year training contents and relative performance were quantied.
results for the entire cohort 8690 of the training was swum at an intensity of
lab 4 mmoll1. this training volume was divided into 4044 at 2 mmoll1
and 4446 at 2 to 4 mmoll1 leaving 69.5 at 46 mmoll1 and 3.54.5
at 6 mmoll1. three sprint ttl patterns were identied a pattern with two long 14
15week macrocycles one with two 1213 week macrocycles each composed of a
balanced training load and one with a single stable at macrocycle. the long pattern
elicited the fastest performances and was most prevalent in olympic quadrennials i.e.
4 seasons preceding the 2004 2008 and 2012 olympic games. this pattern exhibited
moderate weektoweek ttl variability 6  3 progressive training load increases
between macrocycles and more training at 4 mmoll1 and 6 mmoll1. this
fastest sprint pattern showed a waveform in the second macrocycle consisting of two

was the slowest and showed low ttl variability 4  3 training load decreases
between macrocycles p  0.01 and more training at 46 mmoll1 p  0.01.
conclusion progressive increases in training load macrocycles lasting about 14
15 weeks and substantial volume of training at intensities 4 mmoll1 and
6 mmoll1 were associated with peak performance in elite swimmers.

2017 solli et al. 2017 orienteering tnnessen et al. 2015 and
rowing fiskerstrand and seiler 2004 the general preparation
periods are long 1824 weeks and the training load increases
progressively until stabilization. specic training periods may be
shorter 812 weeks and reach a peak load followed by a decrease
just before the competitive phase. in other sports like cycling
schumacher and mueller 2002 triathlon mujika 2014
and kayaking issurin 2016 the annual periodization is
characterized by shorter macrocycles 1216 weeks made up of
general specic and competitive mesocycles lasting 26 weeks.
the periodization methods of elite endurance athletes who
have progressed throughout their careers display increases in
total training load volume training intensity and number of
competitions estevelanao et al. 2005 tnnessen et al. 2014

fiskerstrand and seiler 2004 guellich et al. 2009 triathlon
mujika 2014 and cycling schumacher and mueller 2002
generally show an increase in the total load in the summer as
opposed to winter whereas for crosscountry skiing orienteering
and athletics tnnessen et al. 2014 2015 only the intensity
increases in the second part of the season.
regarding the training intensity distribution the pyramidal
model high proportion of training at lab 2 mmoll1
and a progressive decrease in the proportions at intensities
between 2 and 4 mmoll1 and 4 mmoll1 appears to
apply to most elite endurance athletes stggl and sperlich
2015. however dierences in the proportions of training
intensities are evident among sports indicating that intensity
distribution depends as much on sportspecic techniques as
the duration and energetic prole of the competitive event
stggl and sperlich 2015 mujika et al. 2018. for example
although rowing competitions are among the shortest in terms of
duration 78 min international rowers guellich et al. 2009
perform 8590 of their training at moderate intensity
lab  2.5 mmoll1 and only 3 at severe and extreme
intensity 4 mmoll1. for elite crosscountry skiers the
training contents 8090 at 2.5 mmoll1 35 at 2
4 mmoll1 58 at 4 mmoll1 10 training for strength
and speed are quite similar irrespective of the competition
distance i.e. 1.31.8 km for sprint events and 30 or 50 km
for middistance events sandbakk and holmberg 2017 solli
et al. 2017. lastly in weightbearing sports triathlon cross
country and marathon running the intensity zone distributions
are similar about 7080 at 2.5 mmoll1 2030 at
24 mmoll1 and 510 at 4 mmoll1 even though
the competition events are typically longer billat et al. 2001

studies
comparing
the
training
characteristics of worldclass athletes versus lowerlevel athletes
guellich et al. 2009 sandbakk and holmberg 2017 have
reported 1530 higher training volumes especially in low
intensity zones at lab 2 mmoll1 and higher amounts of
speed training and strength training. elite training has changed
over the past 40 years with most studies reporting changes
in total training volume coupled with a higher proportion of
endurance training at low intensity stggl and sperlich 2015.
we sought to quantify the training of elite swimmers over a
20 years period encompassing multiple olympic games and
world championships.
in swimming observational studies research not interfering
with training scheduling or regimens have shown that the
intensity distribution has shifted from a pyramidal model
with a high proportion of aerobic training in the 1990s over
70 of training at lab  2 mmoll1 mujika et al. 1996
toward models with a high proportion of training between 2
and 4 mmoll1 in the 2000s 3550 avalos et al. 2003
hellard et al. 2006. these studies however report a relatively
small proportion of training above 4 mmoll1 912.

sports organization of the season into two to four macrocycles
of 815 weeks division of each macrocycle into mesocycles or
blocks of 25 weeks and progression from general to specic
training. these reports from coaches at international technical
symposia maglischo 2003 indicate that olympic and world
champion middledistance swimmers 200400 m follow a
predominantly pyramidal model with 5570 of training at
lab  2 mmoll1 and 3040 between 2 and 4 mmoll1
maglischo 2003. in sprint swimming 50100 m the literature
maglischo 2003 reveals two types of distribution in champion
sprinters and olympic medallists with the rst showing an
annual volume of 20002500 km with a consistent proportion
90 of training at 4 mmoll1 pyne and touretski 1993
and the second a smaller annual volume of 1500 km of training
at lab 2 mmoll1 accounting for more than 70 of
the volume and training 4 mmoll1 tending toward 15
barnier 2012. however no study has yet detailed the evolution
of periodization patterns and training characteristics volume
and intensity distributions over multiple olympic cycles and
their relation to competition performance in a large cohort
of elite swimmers.
the aim of this study was to investigate the patterns
and characteristics of training proles in elite swimming
to gain insight into longterm periodization. this work is
based on a large cohort of elite french swimmers followed
for a median of 3 years. we analyzed the training loads
quantied over the 25 weeks preceding the best annual
performance of 127 national and international swimmers.
the proles were related to factors such as the year in
the olympic cycle event specicity technique distance and
sex age performance level and training contents. this
information will inform the planning and evaluation of elitelevel
swimming training.

internationally
ranked
male
and
female
swimmers
and
their competition performance times were recorded over 20
competitive seasons. all swimmers trained in one of two national
training centers. swimmers were excluded if they had a chronic
pathology illness andor injury requiring medical treatment
had missed training for 4 weeks or more or were taking
medication known to aect immune function or inammation.
only swimmers who met the inclusion criteria were selected.
the experimental study was conducted in accordance with
the declaration of helsinki. the study was approved by the
institutional review board of the host site institut national du
sport de lexpertise et de la performance and all participants
gave written informed consent. written informed consent was
obtained from the parents for all participants under the age of
16 years old. in addition individual swimmerseasons with very
slow performances or noticeably irregular training programs
were excluded. the study sample therefore comprised 289
individual swimmerseasons corresponding to 127 swimmers
followed for a median of 3 years range 111.
sixty swimmers were male and 67 were female aged between
15 and 30 years. four swimmers specialized in 50 m and 42 in
100m events sprinters 52 swimmers specialized in 200 m and
29 in 400 m and longer distances middledistance. fortysix
sprint swimmers specialized although not exclusively in front
crawl 27 in breaststroke 18 in buttery and 14 in backstroke.
five middledistance swimmers specialized in breaststroke 37 in
front crawl 11 in buttery 10 in backstroke and 18 in individual
medley. the swimmers competed in 7  4 mean  sd
competitions per season.
training and performance measures
all performance p times in seconds at ocial competitions in
olympic size 50 m pool were recorded. to account for yearto
year changes in competition conditions  for example period
of fullbody polyurethanebased swimsuits in 20072009  the
performance times are expressed relative to the mean of the 10
best world performance times m10wp in a given year for a
given sex stroke and distance pr   100pm10wp
m10wp
 where
pr indicates a swimmers relative performance the lower the
pr value the closer a swimmers performance to the current
m10wp. only each swimmers best performance of the season
was taken into account.
the intensities for quantifying the swim workouts at the
two national centers were determined using the method
of mujika et al. 1996 under the supervision of the french
swimming federation. an incremental test to exhaustion was
performed at the beginning of each season repeated and adjusted
4 times per season to determine the relationship between blood
lactate concentration and swimming speed. each subject swam

6 m  200 m at progressively higher percentages of their personal
best competition time culminating in a maximal eort on the
sixth and nal swim. lactate concentration was measured in
capillary blood collected from the ngertip during the 1min
recovery period separating the 200 m swims mujika et al. 1996.
all swimming sessions were categorized into ve intensity
levels i1 below 2 mmoll1 i2 from 2 to 4 mmoll1 i3
above 46 mmoll1 i4 above 6 mmoll1 and i5 maximal
swimming speed. the speeds corresponding to each intensity
level were then corrected to account for the swimming distance
and rest intervals using olbrecht et al. 1985. for a female
world champion and olympic medalist typical i1 and i2 training
sets were respectively 30 m  100 m with 15 s rest swum in
110 mins with lab  1.5 mmoll1 and 20 m  100 m with
40s rest swum in 106 mins with lab  3.8 mmoll1. a typical
i3 training set for the same swimmer was 12 m  100 m with 25s
rest swum in 103 mins with lab  5.8 mmoll1. a typical i4
training set was 8 m  50 m with 30s rest swum in a mean 28.6 s
with lab  7.6 mmoll1. inwater workouts were quantied in
meters per week at each intensity level.
strength training included dryland workouts at maximal

fernandes and vilasboas 2012. for each swimmer and each
season training for the 25 weeks preceding the best performance
of the season was quantied.
in this study we analyzed training intensities and workouts
with four approaches
1 absolute training loads. each individual swimmers mean of
absolute training volumes were calculated over the 25 weeks
preceding the seasons best performance. inwater workouts
were quantied weekly in meters at each intensity level
and summarized through the individual mean over the
25 weeks. dryland workouts were quantied weekly in
minutes of active exercise and averaged over the 25 weeks.
2 progressivity. to investigate progressivity in the training
proles we compared the dierences in each individuals
mean over the rst and second halves of the 25 weeks
training period.
3 distribution. each individual swimmers mean intensity
distribution was determined. the individuals proportion
of mhi si and ei were calculated as the mean mhi si
and ei over the 25 weeks relative to the mean total inwater
workout over the 25 weeks respectively. the proportion of
general conditioning was calculated as the mean of the total
dryland training. the proportions of intensity distributions
varied between 0 and 1 and their sum was 1 with the
proportions of general conditioning and strength training
in the form of compositional data baconshone 2011.
4 total training load ttl and variation in ttl. for each
swimmer and each season the weekly proportion of pool
and dryland training were scaled as a percentage of the
maximal volume measured at the same intensity level.
thus for each swimmer season and intensity the values
were rescaled between 0 and 100 and the maximum
100 was achieved in at least 1 week which facilitated
comparisons across time and between swimmers. the
weekly ttl calculated as the mean normalized volumes
for both inwater and dryland workouts all 5 in 
summarized the weekly training volume and intensity
relative to the swimmers capacities avalos et al. 2003
hellard et al. 2017. the training prole analyses were
based on ttl. the variation in training was measured as
the mean dierence in ttl between two consecutive weeks
in. this measure was used to summarize dierences in
variability between training proles.
covariates
several factors may aect adaptations to a training program.
we considered the following covariates age at the time of
competition sex stroke the quarter phase of the season
accounting for the relative importance of the competitions i.e.
national competitions typically in the rst and second quarters
and international competitions in the third season number since
entry into the study as a marker of a swimmers experience
and the season of the quadrennial postolympic world
championships preolympic and olympic seasons accounting
for the absolute importance of the competitions. we also
considered two distance classes sprint swimmers specialized in
50m or 100m events and middledistance swimmers specialized
in the 200m andor 400m.
statistical analysis
training for the 25 weeks preceding each swimmers best
performance of the season was used in the analyses since
this was the longest period common to all subjects between
the beginning and the best performance of the season. the
analyses were stratied by two distance classes sprint swimmers
and middledistance swimmers. however there was substantial
heterogeneity in the analysis of the middledistance swimmers
training trajectories.
first we described the sample in terms of covariates. all
analyses were stratied by the two distance classes.
secondly we used latent class mixed models to identify
the ttl pattern groups over time. this model combines a
latent class model to identify homogeneous latent groups of
frontiers in physiology  
april 2019  volume 10  article 363
hellard et al.
the fastest training patterns of elite swimmers
subjects and a mixed model to describe the mean trajectory
over time in each latent group while taking into account the
individual correlation between repeated measures. the hlme
function of the lcmm rpackage was used to estimate the model
parameters proustlima et al. 2018. the training trajectories
were described according to the number of weeks preceding the
best performance of the season using spline functions without
adjustment for baseline covariates. the shapes of the group
specic and subjectspecic trajectories were determined by
comparing models with an increasing number of parameters
115 knots in the spline functions of time a diagonal or
unstructured randomeect covariance matrix and a class
specic or proportional randomeect covariance matrix. the
best model among those with the same number of groups
was selected using the akaike information criterion. individual
class membership was not xed and estimated on the highest
probability of belonging to a given class from a multinomial
logistic model. in each run the number of distinct classes had
to be specied. the decision about the number of latent classes
15 was based on both the bayesian information criterion and
interpretation of the distinct groups.
thirdly we characterized the highlighted proles in terms
of demographic characteristics swim specialty timevariant
covariates distribution of training intensities and relative
performance. anova or kruskalwallis rank sum tests if
anova conditions were not fullled were used to determine
dierences in training volumes among groups. paired t or
wilcoxon signedrank tests if ttest conditions were not
fullled were used to determine dierences within each rst
half and secondhalf pair of training volumes. manovas
were used to determine dierences in inwater training
proportions and dryland training proportions after applying
the isometric logratio transformation for compositional data
among groups baconshone 2011. given the exploratory
nature of this observational study association tests between
proles and covariates were performed on the assumption that
the number of proles was correct and subjects were classied
correctly with a signicance level of 0.05 and without applying
multiplicity corrections.

identication
the total number of swimmerseasons analyzed was 105. three
groups each with a distinct training prole were identied
over the 25 weeks preceding the best performance of the
season figure 1 right axis. the mean probability of belonging
to the assigned group was high 91 indicating very
reliable classication. the long group and the balanced group
showed twomacrocycle proles with marked uctuations in
each macrocycle consisting of a progressive load increase in
the beginning of the macrocycle one or two load peaks lasting
13 weeks and a progressive load decrease lasting 24 weeks
corresponding to the taper period. the stable flat group showed
a more regular pattern and a longer second cycle approximately
16 vs. 13 weeks with a ttl of about 60 with minor deviations
during taper. respectively 53 24 and 23 of the swimmer
seasons were classied into the long balanced and stable flat
groups. among swimmers followed for more than one season

characterization
in terms of performance training contents and distributions
sprint trajectory groups could be characterized as follows. the
group corresponding to a pattern of long macrocycles was
the fastest characterized by a medium training load medium
variability training load progressivity between the rst and
second macrocycles two load peaks highest load in each
macrocycle 21 and 5 weeks before their best performance
and an intensity distribution with a greater amount of training
at lab 4 mmoll1 and 6 mmoll1. the group
corresponding to a pattern of balanced macrocycles was
characterized by a low training load high variability degressivity
between the rst and second macrocycles two load peaks 19 and
10 weeks before the best performance and a moderate quantity
of training at 46 mmoll1. the group corresponding to a
pattern of stable flat macrocycles was the slowest characterized
by a high training load low variability degressivity between the
rst and second macrocycles a single load peak 8 weeks before bp
and the highest quantity of training at lab  46 mmoll1.
the group corresponding to a pattern of stable flat
macrocycles presented the lowest variation figure 1 measured

the long group showed the best performance 6.0  3.1

discussion
this research is the rst to analyze dierent periodization
methods and their contents over several olympic cycles in a
large cohort of elite male and female swimmers including nine
olympic or world championships medalists. the study period
covered 20 competitive seasons resulting in 105 swimmer
seasons for sprinters and 184 swimmerseasons for middle
distance swimmers with individual followup ranging from 1
to 11 seasons. the extent of the modeling is also indicated by
the detailed analysis of the 25week seasons which captured
the entire preparation for national competitions and the major
international meet of each season.
the use of latent class mixed models provided empirical
identication of three distinct training proles in sprint
swimmers and four proles in middledistance swimmers. we
characterized these groups in terms of performance training
load contents variability of training progressivity and training
distribution. for the 289 swimmerseasons 8690 of the
training was swum at an intensity of lab 4 mmoll1. this
training volume was divided into 4044 at 2 mmoll1
and 4446 at 2 to 4 mmoll1 leaving 69.5 at 4
6 mmoll1 and 3.54.5 at 6 mmoll1. although each
training prole showed a large dispersion in the performances
the group of sprint swimmers corresponding to the pattern
of long macrocycles characterized by macrocycles lasting
1516 weeks medium training load medium variability
progressivity between the two macrocycles a load peak
4 weeks before bp and a distribution characterized by a
greater amount of training 4 and 6 mmoll1 had
the fastest performances. conversely the sprint swimmers
owing the stable flat pattern and the middledistance
swimmers who followed a short pattern both characterized
by the highest training load degressivity between the two
macrocycles a load peak 8 and 6 weeks before bp and
a greater amount of training at 46 mmoll1 were
the
slowest.

outcomes
support
the
assertion
that
contemporary swimming periodization should give priority
to macrocycles that last 1316 weeks with sucient training

greatest portions of training at 4 mmoll1 8590 and

running cycling rowing and crosscountry skiing which
showed the high prevalence of a pyramidal distribution with
a smaller proportion of training at intensities between 2 and
4 mmoll1. these observational studies of exerciseintensity
distribution in endurance sports billat et al. 2001 estevelanao
et al. 2005 guellich et al. 2009 sandbakk and holmberg 2017
reported that highlevel athletes typically perform 7580 of
their training below the aerobic or ventilatory threshold about
2 mmoll1 and 515 above the lactate threshold about
4 mmoll1 stggl and sperlich 2015. our analysis of the
swimming data highlighted a higher percentage of training in
the 24 mmoll1 zone 4446 in contrast to the training
contents for other endurance sports which show a proportion
of approximately 216 of training at intensities in this intensity
zone. in swimming the speeds and stroke rates corresponding to
intensities 2 mmoll1 are much slower than those of actual
competition e.g. a female world champion performed a set
of 10 m100 m corresponding to a lab of 1.5 mmoll1 at
a swim speed of 1.2 m.s1 and a stroke rate of 25.5 s.min1
whereas her competition speed was 1.82 m.s1 with a stroke
rate of 49 s.min1. at these slower speeds corresponding to
lab 2 mmoll1 catchup coordination induces intracyclic
velocity variations and an increase in energy cost vilasboas
et al. 2011. in contrast distance per stroke and swimming
eciency have been shown as the highest around the maximal
lactate steady state speed corresponding to lab 35 mmoll1
dekerle et al. 2005. in summary better technical eciency
in the 24 mmoll1 zone may be one of the reasons for

the greater proportion of swimming training in these zones
compared with other cyclical endurance sports e.g. cross
country skiing etc..
the fastest proles for both sprinters and middledistance
swimmers were characterized by a greater amount of training
up to lab 4 mmoll1 and above 6 mmoll1. these
outcomes need to be analyzed in context with the conclusions
of
the
observational
and
experimental
studies
in
high
level athletes showing greater eciency with the socalled
polarized distribution 7080 2 mmoll1
and 10
20 4 mmoll1 in running billat et al. 2001 rowing
fiskerstrand and seiler 2004 cycling neal et al. 2013
and crosscountry skiing tnnessen et al. 2014. however
relative to the polarized model the polarized training zones
in our study appeared to be moved upward the fastest groups
performed a lower proportion of si 46 mmoll1 training
and higher mhi and ei proportions. these results agree with
those of arroyotoledo et al. 2013 who observed in young
regional level swimmers a smaller performance improvement
in 100 m following a traditional periodization mean training
volume of 23 km per week and an intensity distribution of 69
2 mmoll1 25 24 mmoll1 and 6 4 mmoll1
compared with a reverse periodization weekly volume of
16 km intensity distribution 49 33 and 18 0.4 vs. 6.9
respectively. in summary 88 moderatetoheavy intensity
8 severe intensity and 4 extremeintensity training for sprint
swimmers and 8974 for middledistance swimmers with
about the half performed below 2 mmoll1 reects a good
compromise in swimming between technical eciency sizeable
physiological adaptations and management of training stress.
training proles  olympic quadrennials
and their seasons
olympic quadrennials and the seasons of the olympic cycle were
represented dierently in the training proles. these dierences
cannot easily be explained by the scheduling of competition
dates as they varied considerably over the 20 years of the
study. the variations more likely reect the evolution in the
training approaches of the coaches who trained the participants.
concerning the traditional methodological streams a few authors
have proposed a periodization model at the scale of a single
olympic quadrennial maglischo 2003 platonov 2006 lyakh
et al. 2014. for instance platonov suggested that an annual
periodization composed of two to three macrocycles would be

appropriate for olympic and world championship seasons
and that a multicycle periodization 47 macrocycles per year
could be employed in intermediate seasons e.g. continental
or regional championships platonov 2006. maglischo 2003
advocated an increase in volume and intensity during the years
with olympic games and world championships. however the
results of the present work do not agree with these assertions. for
sprint swimmers the most frequent and successful patterns in
olympic and world championships seasons showed a medium
total training load and progression from moderatetoheavy
to severe to extreme intensity training from the rst to the
second macrocycle. in addition during pre and postolympic
seasons we observed higher training volumes at moderate
to heavy intensities lab 4 mmoll1 in sprinters and
higher dryland workout volumes in middledistance swimmers
suggesting these years of the olympic quadrennial should be
dedicated to developing less specic tness.
the increased intensity during highstakes competitive
seasons olympic games world championships has been
observed among worldclass endurance athletes on a yearly
scale tnnessen et al. 2014 2015. as the major competitions
of the season approach the specicity and intensity of the
training increases and nonspecic training decreases. for the
sprint swimmers in our analysis it is worth noting that the
stable flat macrocycle pattern group was mostly represented
by the september 1996september 2000 quadrennial whereas
the group corresponding to a pattern of long macrocycles
was mostly represented by the most recent quadrennials. we
assume that the periodization methods presented over the
last 15 years in methodological platonov 2006 and sports
science seiler and kjerland 2006 literature as well as the
hardearned experiences of leading coaches communicated
within the coaching community have prompted changes in
coaching practices.
training proles  macrocycle duration
and shape
a 25weeks study period corresponds roughly to two typical
macrocycles of 1216 weeks that precede either the national
selection or the major international summer championships.
frontiers in physiology  
april 2019  volume 10  article 363
hellard et al.
the fastest training patterns of elite swimmers
over the study period 47 of the swimmers achieved their
best performance in the rst macrocycle typically leading to
the national selection trials and 53 in the second macrocycle
leading to major international competition. in the fastest
sprint group the second macrocycle lasted approximately 14
15 weeks. training plans for some other endurance sports
rnnestad et al. 2014 tnnessen et al. 2014 have similar
cycles or longer. in middledistance trackandeld events
tnnessen et al. 2014 tnnessen et al. 2015 triathlon and
cycling rnnestad et al. 2014 the macrocycles typically last
1214 weeks or more. long cycles induce the cumulative eects
in both physiological capabilities and physicaltechnical abilities
resulting from longterm athletic training platonov 2006
lyakh et al. 2014 issurin 2016. there is evidence that the
time course of physiological adaptations in training cycles lasts
between 4 and 20 weeks holliday and jeukendrup 2012. most
of the metabolic neuromuscular and cardiovascular adaptations
to training that begin in the rst 23 weeks culminate between
4 and 7 weeks and continue up to the 12th week or more.
consequently a macrocycle of about 15 weeks seems eective to
prepare swimmers for major competition.
the fastest sprint prole showed a waveform in the second
macrocycle consisting of two progressive load peaks 1011 and
46 weeks before competition. training in the several weeks
before a major competition clearly inuences performance with
a positive impact of the general preparation mesocycle i.e.
weeks 911 prior to competition hellard et al. 2017. in the
fastest prole these two peaks were separated by a load decrease.
conversely the slowest training prole was characterized by
a stable evolution with little variability. the observed wave
periodization is similar to that described for models in the
methodological literature maglischo 2003 platonov 2006
lyakh et al. 2014 and in the scientic and technical reports
describing the training of olympic and worldclass sprint
swimmers pyne and touretski 1993 barnier 2012. in these
models a phase devoted to developing strength and aerobic
endurance is planned 811 weeks before the major competition.
this phase is followed by the development of more specic
qualities maximal aerobic power maximal anaerobic lactic
power and race pace intensity training generally 46 weeks

training proles  training volumes
variation in total training load
the fastest prole among the sprint swimmers showed medium
variations in training load whereas the slowest one was
characterized by low variability. the slowest prole in the
middle distance swimmers showed high variability. systematic
not excessive variations in volume and intensity can yield
greater longterm adaptations than training programs with a
single and constant load issurin 2016. compared with the
linear periodization method associated with long macrocycles
1824 weeks or more which are characterized by progressively
increasing training loads followed by the stabilization that
precedes the load decrease in competitive periods the training of

mesocycles focused on the simultaneous development of two
to three priority qualities interspersed with short periods of
reduced training maglischo 2003. these periodization practices
are close to the socalled multitargeted block periodization
method issurin 2016 which consists of three types of
block mesocycles accumulation development of endurance
transmutation acquisition of specic technical motor skills
and realization taper specic preparation for competitive
events all of similar duration 24 weeks. the aim of
this method is to develop energetic qualities and promote
ecient transfer of general adaptations strength and aerobic
endurance to specic adaptations anaerobic endurance with
minimal risk of overtraining garcapallars et al. 2010 issurin
2016. the eectiveness of this method was experimentally
conrmed in worldclass kayakers garcapallars et al.
2010 welltrained cyclists rnnestad et al. 2014 as a 12
week block periodization yielded greater improvements in
strength maximal power output mpo power output at blood
lactate concentrations of 24 mmoll1 and performance than
traditional linear periodization. in summary in macrocycles
of about 15 weeks swimmers coaches and sports scientists
should consider periodization involving two to three mesocycles
each lasting from 3 to 5 weeks interspersed with recovery
periods 12 weeks.
training proles  progressivity
our results support the positive association between a progressive
load increase from the rst macrocycle to the second and
sprint performance. the fastest prole showed progressive
increases from one macrocycle to another and even within
the last macrocycle. conversely in both sprint and middle
distance swimmers the slowest proles showed load decreases
between the rst and second macrocycles. the conceptual
support for the principle of progressivity was inspired by
the pioneering theory of selye 1976 the general adaptation
syndrome which described the adaptation to stress in three
phases 1 alarm 2 adaptationresistance and 3 exhaustion.
after an acute response in the rst phase adaptation and
performance increases in the second phase but can stagnate
in the third phase if the training stimulus remains constant.
training theorists have argued that the progressive nature of
a training load facilitates a gradual increase in the training
stimulus platonov 2006 dantas et al. 2010 lyakh et al.
2014. adaptive training processes are thus engaged because
frontiers in physiology

hellard et al.
the fastest training patterns of elite swimmers
a stimulus of greater magnitude is induced kraemer and
ratamess 2004 american college of sports medicine acsm
2009. progressive overloading should be introduced gradually
into a program and the swimmer should have sucient time
to adapt before coaches impose a new training load increment.
the acsm recommends that changes in total strength training
volume reps sets and load be in increments of 2.55.0 per
week to avoid overtraining. although few studies have directly
demonstrated the eectiveness of an increasing training load
compared with a constant or decreasing load in endurance
sports dantas et al. 2010 indicated that traditional models
based on progressive increases in load and intensity were most
eective. moreover experimental studies suggest that the greatest
improvements in performance and physiological measures are
associated with the progressive nature of the training load.
for instance cyclists who made the most progress increased
vo2 max and power output at 2 mmoll1 after a blocktype
training program had more pronounced increases in volume and
higher intensity than cyclists who followed a traditional training
program rnnestad et al. 2014. a progressive increase in the
training load over the season either through an increase in ttl
when it varies in a uniform way or through the stabilization
of ttl associated with a progressive increase in specicity and
intensity is a methodological principle most likely linked to
the progression in performances. clearly swimming coaches
should consider increasing the low and highintensity training
loads from the rst to the second half of the approximate 6
month summer or winter season leading to major national or
international competitions.
take home message
for sprinters coaches must consider the eectiveness of a
progressive total training load from within and between each
macrocycle until the beginning of the taper. training load peaks
should be located 7 6 and 5 weeks before major competitions.
for both sprint and middledistance swimmers it is advisable to
avoid a large decrease in total training load between macrocycles
and excessive training at swimming speeds corresponding to a
blood lactate concentration between 4 and 6 mmoll1.
limitations
the end of the study period in 2012 is one of the limitations
of this research. a recent review of the scientic and
technical literature hawke 2010 barnier 2012 vergnoux 2014
vandenbogaerde et al. 2019 gives a more actual description
of training in the last decade. in the period 20102018 the
training of middledistance swimmers 200400 m has been
characterized by high volume long continuous macrocycles
priority given to aerobic and threshold training a short taper
and strong general physical preparation. the distribution of
intensities has been characterized by a predominantly aerobic
distribution with 5570 below lab 2 mmoll1 and 30
40 between lab 2 mmoll1 and lab 4 mmoll1.
in sprint swimming 50100 m the literature reveals two
models in champion sprinters and olympic medalists with
the rst showing a high annual training volume 2000
2500 km with a consistent proportion of aerobic and threshold
training below lab 4 mmoll1 about 90 of the total
training time and the second showing a lower volume 1000
1500 km composed of a high intensity training volume below
lab  2 mmoll1 higher than 70 and volume lab  4
mmoll1 tending toward 15. this swimming training is
associated with daily dryland training focused on increasing
maximum strength power and training capabilities.
secondly
the
training
load
quantication
was
based
exclusively on lactate measurements which provides only a
partial view and is subject to measurement error. thirdly several
covariates besides the training load may impact performance
bourdon et al. 2017. a swimmers basal tness current
life constraints nutrition recovery measures psychological
responses and technical quality during training are some of
the potential unmeasured confounding factors. also as our
analyses were based on the marginal associations between
the dierent proles in the load changes and various training
characteristics distribution progressivity and variability the
association between the prole characteristics and performance
eciency cannot be inferred to be causal. a future study should
statistically assess the links between these training parameters
and performance improvement.
conclusion
we identied training proles from a 20year cohort of elite
french swimmers and characterized them in terms of relative
performance season within the olympic quadrennial olympic
quadrennial and training contents. training practices have
clearly evolved over the years and advances in scientic
and empirical knowledge may have contributed to changes
in practices. we note that pre and postolympic swimming
seasons seem to be dedicated to developing less sportspecic
tness while particularly for sprinters the olympic games
and world championship seasons show a progression from
low to highintensity training from the rst to the second
macrocycle. in sprinters the fastest group showed a progressive
load increase from the rst to the second half of a 6month
period leading to major competitions. conversely in both sprint
and middledistance swimmers the slowest groups showed
load decreases between the two macrocycles. a traditional
macrocycle of about 15 weeks comprising two to three
mesocycles each lasting about 46 weeks interspersed with
recovery periods seems to be a widely established practice for
preparing swimmers for major competitions. finally swimming
training distributions were 8889 at 4 mmoll1 with half
2 mmoll1 and 4 at 6 mmoll1 which diers from
the more polarized distributions reported for other endurance
sports. a possible explanation for this dierence could be the
higher technical swimming eciency in the 2 to 4 mmoll1
training intensity zone.
