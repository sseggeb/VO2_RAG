in shortterm studies block periodization of highintensity training hit has been shown
to be an effective strategy that enhances performance and related physiological factors.
however longterm studies and detailed investigations of macro meso and micro
periodization of hit blocks in worldclass endurance athletes are currently lacking.
in a recent study we showed that the worlds most successful crosscountry xc
skier used two different periodization models with success throughout her career. one
including extensive use of hit blocks namely bp and one using a traditional method
namely trad. in this study we compare bp with trad in two comparable successful
seasons and provide a detailed description of the annual use of hit blocks in bp. the
participant is the mostdecorated winter olympian with 8 olympic gold medals 18
world championship titles and 114 world cup victories. training data was categorized
by training form endurance strength and speed intensity low lit moderate mit
and hit and mode running cycling and skiingroller skiing. no signicant difference
was found in the total endurance training load between bp and trad. however training
volume in bp was lower compared to trad 15  6 vs. 18  7 hwk p  0.001 mainly
explained by less lit 13  5 vs. 15  5 hwk p  0.004. lower volume of mit was also
performed in bp compared to trad 13 vs. 38 sessionsyear whereas the amount of
hit was higher in bp 157 vs. 77 sessionsyear. while bp included high amounts of hit
already from the rst preparation period followed by a reduction toward the competition
period trad had a progressive increase in hit toward the competition period. in bp
the athlete performed seven hit blocks varying from 7 to 11 days each including 813
hit sessions. this study provides novel insights into successful utilization of two different
periodization models in the worlds best xc skier and illustrates the macro meso and
micro periodization of hit blocks to increase the overall amount of hit.

block vs. traditional periodization of hit
introduction
crosscountry xc skiing is regarded as one of the most
demanding endurance sports with training and competition
challenging every step of the oxygen transport chain. thus xc
skiers training primarily targets the aerobic endurance capacity
and the most common training model among xc skiers includes
700850 h of endurance training distributed as 90 low lit
45 as moderate mit and 58 as highintensity training
hit sandbakk and holmberg 2017. although hit sessions
normally make up only one to three of the weekly training
sessions of xc skiers and many other endurance athletes or
20 of the total annual number of sessions seiler 2010 stggl
and sperlich 2015 they are keys in eliciting physiological and
performance gains laursen and jenkins 2002 buchheit and
laursen 2013ab. in fact it is argued that an increased volume
andor frequency of hit would be benecial for the further
development of elite endurance athletes laursen 2010.
independent of the overall intensity distribution most studies
report that the periodization of hit vs. mit and lit in xcskiing
is achieved via the traditional periodization model matwejew
1975 issurin 2008 tnnessen et al. 2014. utilization of this
model is characterized by mixed focus on lit mit and hit
in all periods but with a gradual progression from high training
volume to higher training intensity reduced volume and training
that is more specic as the competition period approaches.
however the traditional periodization model has received
criticism because of possible conicting physiological adaptations
produced by the mixed training of many performancerelated
factors simultaneously. as an alternative it has been argued that a
more eective way of organizing endurance training is to include
dened blocks of increased focus on specic intensities issurin
2008 2010 2016 2018.
in this context blocks of highly concentrated hit stimulus
aims to induce a benecial metabolic impact and appropriate
hormonal response to optimize the subsequent adaptations
issurin 2018. while positive shortterm eects of using hit
blocks to augment training responses have been shown breil
et al. 2010 stren et al. 2012 wahl et al. 2013 clark et al.
2014 rnnestad et al. 2017 only a small number of studies have
compared block periodization of hit with evenly distributed
hitmatched traditionalmodels. some of these studies reported
superior improvements by using hit blocks among national
level cyclists and xc skiers rnnestad et al. 2014ab 2016
whereas a recent study of junior xc skiers reported no benecial
eects of blocking compared to an evenly distribution of hit
mcgawley et al. 2017. however these studies have compared
the dierent periodization models by matching the overall
hit stimulus whereas the use of block periodization of hit
in a reallife context is often related to an increase in the
overall hit stimulus.
although one longterm study followed a national level
male cyclist through 58 weeks of systematic blocking of lit
mit and hit rnnestad and hansen 2018 most previous
studies on block periodization of hit are limited by short
intervention periods 412 weeks and none have examined
endurance athletes at a worldclass level. furthermore there is
a lack of detailed investigations into macro meso and micro
periodization utilizing hit blocks and evidence on how this
model is distinguished from the traditional model according to
the organization of training across the annual cycle in worldclass
endurance athletes.
in a recent study we showed that the worlds most successful
xc skier used two dierent periodization models with success
throughout her career solli et al. 2017. one including extensive
use of hit blocks namely bp and a traditional method namely
trad. in this followup case study the main aims are to compare
bp with trad in two comparably successful seasons in the
worlds best xc skier and to provide a detailed description of her
annual use of hit blocks. this will provide novel information on
the macro meso and microorganization of lit mit and hit
and generate new hypotheses for followup studies.
materials and methods
participant
the participant is the mostdecorated winter olympian with 8
olympic gold medals 18 world championship titles and 114
world cup victories fis 2018. the study was evaluated by
the regional ethics committee of midnorway and approved
by the norwegian social science data services nsd. written
informed consent was obtained from the participant for
publication of this study which was performed according to the
helsinki declarations.
overall design
this study builds on a previous longitudinal training study
solli et al. 2017 identifying two training periodization models
block and traditional periodization of hit in the skiers
training patterns. here the detailed training content during one
representative year using block periodization of hit bp 2005
2006 season and one representative year using the traditional
model trad 20142015. the years was selected based on
three criteria 1 successful performance during the examined
year she won world cup races in both sprint 0.81.3 km
and distance 1030 km races in both seasons which led to
victory in the sprint and overall world cup 2 equal endurance
training load etl based on training impulse trimp and
3 detailed information about the design of training sessions
throughout the seasons.
monitoring registration and
systematization of training
the participant recorded all training data in diaries designed
by the norwegian ski association and the norwegian olympic
federation to provide a valid and accurate measurement of
training sylta et al. 2014. all training data was systematized
by phases general preparation 1 and 2 gp1 and gp2 specic
preparation sp and competition phase cp training form

registration and systematization of training data division of
training phases determination of intensity zones categorization
of lit mit and hit sessions as well as the content of speed
and strength sessions are previously described solli et al. 2017.
illness days and periods was registered based on the participants
systematic reporting in the training diaries. etl was calculated
by multiplying the accumulated duration of the intensity by a
multiplier for the particular intensity zone e.g. 1 min at lit
mit and hit is given a score of 1 2 and 3 trimp respectively.
total etl trimp score is then obtained by summating the
results foster et al. 2001. the performance development
throughout the season was investigated by comparing the average
rank in international competitions world cup races and the
worldolympic championships in the rst i.e. races before the
major championships and the second phase i.e. races from the
major championships and throughout the rest of the competitive
season. since the average amount of mit and hit was 23
sessions per week solli et al. 2017 the denition of a hitblock
was set as 4 sessions of hit not including competitions over
a 7 days period.
interviews
to gather additional information ensure compliance with the
training diary commentaries and verify the training intensity
of dierent training sessions both semistructured interviews
and specic questions regarding the experience of the two
periodization models were conducted with the participant
and her coaches.
statistical analyses
all data from the investigated periods are presented as
mean  standard deviation sd. variables with normal
distribution were analyzed by using a pairedsample ttest for
bp vs. trad. otherwise the wilcoxon signedrank test was
used. all statistical tests were processed using ibm spss statistics

comparisons of block and traditional
periodization of hit
total training volume and load
no signicant dierence was found in the weekly etl between
bp and trad 1058  368 vs. 1084  339 trimp. average
weekly training volume was 15 lower in bp compared to
trad table 1 p  0.001. total annual training volume was
795 h distributed across 478 sessions in bp and 938 h over 538
sessions in trad. the average weekly etl and volume across
the dierent phases are presented in table 1 and figure 1a.
the average rank in international competitions in the two
investigated seasons was 4.2  4.4 2.95.6 in the rst and second
phase respectively in bp vs. 2.8  5.8 1.4 5.8 in the rst and
second phase respectively in trad. total annual days spent at
altitude were 58 and 54 during bp and trad respectively. the
same number 36 of days without training were found in bp and
trad. the number of illness days was seven one period in cp
in bp compared to nine one period in gp1 one period in gp2
and one in cp in trad.
distribution of training forms and exercise modes
the training forms in bp were distributed as 746 h 94
endurance 40 h 5 strength and 10 h 1 speed training
compared to 836 h 89 endurance 86 h 9 strength and
15 h 2 speed training in trad. weekly endurancetraining
volume was 11 lower in bp compared to trad table 1
p  0.019. the weekly strength training time was 54 lower in
bp vs. trad table 1 p  0.001 this was present in all phases
except cp. no dierence was found in maximal strength training
between bp and trad but a much higher amount of general
strength training 48 vs. 0.4 h was performed during trad. the
weekly speed training time was 37 lower in bp compared to
trad table 1 p  0.023. the distribution of training forms
across phases is presented in figure 1b.
the distribution of specicnonspecic exercise modes was
approximately similar 6139 in bp and trad. no dierences
between the weekly amount of specic vs. nonspecic training
were found across the annual phases except for 65 higher
volume of nonspecic exercise modes in cp during trad
table 1 p  0.016.
endurance training
according to the time spent in each intensity zone the
distribution of litmithit was 88111 in bp and 9244
in trad. quantied in terms of the number of sessions this was
61336 in bp and 76816 in trad.
the volume of lit was 15 lower in bp than trad table 1
p  0.004. further bp included 34 more lit time performed as
warm up or cool down in connection with mit hit or strength
sessions table 1 p  0.006 while 28 more of the lit volume
in trad was performed as sessions 90 min table 1 p  0.002.
the lit time and sessions across the dierent categories of
duration in bp and trad are presented in figure 1c.
a substantially lower number of mit sessions was performed
in bp than trad 13 vs. 38 sessions. accordingly weekly mit
time was 70 lower in bp than trad table 1 p  0.001.
the annual number of hit sessions was much higher during bp
157 vs. 77 sessions and weekly hit time was 121 higher in
bp compared to trad table 1 p  0.001. the progression
of mit and hit from gp1 to cp was dierent between bp and
trad. while bp included high amounts of hit already in the
beginning of the annual training cycle followed by a reduction
toward cp trad had a progressive increase of hit toward cp.
the distribution of mit and hit time and sessions across the
annual phases is presented in figure 1d.

block vs. traditional periodization of hit
discussion
in this study we compared the use of block and traditional
periodization of hit in two comparable successful seasons of
the worlds best xc skier and provided a detailed description of
macro meso and microorganization of hit blocks across an
annual cycle. despite equal etl in bp and trad a signicantly
higher training volume was found in trad mainly due to
longer duration of lit sessions and more mit. in contrast
twice as many hitsessions were performed during bp. the
progression and distribution of hit also diered between the
2 years trad included a progressive increase in hit toward
cp whereas bp included high amounts of hit already in gp1
followed by a reduction toward cp. during bp the athlete
performed seven major hit blocks varying from 7 to 11 days
with each including 813 hit sessions. this contrasts with
the organization of hit in trad in which only half the
number of hit sessions were performed evenly distributed as
13 sessionwk.
comparisons of block and traditional
periodization of hit
this is the rst study comparing successful utilization of block
and traditional periodization of hit in a worldclass endurance
athlete where hit blocks were used to signicantly increase the
amount of hit. in this case the total etl did not dier between
the two investigated years allowing for a valid comparison of
the athletes macro meso and microorganization of training
volume intensity distribution content as well as the design of
training sessions.
a higher endurance training volume was found in trad
which
was
primarilly
explained
by
more
lit
15
vs.
13 hwk including longer duration lit sessions 5 vs. 3
sessionswk  90 min. more frequent exposure to longer
duration lit sessions in trad might have induced a positive
longterm physiological adaptation that has also been highlighted
in previous studies seiler 2010. in bp lit was still a
large proportion of the overall endurance training volume
but much of the lit was performed as shorter bouts of
warm up or cool down in connection with hit sessions.
whether the total volume of lit independent of type of
sessions vs. a high volume due to longer duration lit
sessions plays a role for the endurance adaptations is currently
not known. as a compensation for the lower amount of
lit as well as less mit 13 vs. 38 sessions in bp than
trad substantially more hit training was performed 157
vs. 77 sessions resulting in similar etl across these two
periodization models.
according to the time spent in each intensity zone the
distribution of litmithit time was 9244 in trad
and 88111 in bp demonstrating a higher proportion of
hit in bp than previously reported in xc skiers tnnessen
et al. 2014 sandbakk et al. 2016 sandbakk and holmberg
2017. quantied in terms of the number of sessions the
intensity distribution in bp is further distinguished from
trad and previous studies on xc skiing. in fact the
number of sessions at each intensity level shows a polarized
distribution of 61336 for litmithit in bp. this number
of hit sessions in combination with the large annual training
volume 800 h is among the highest amount of hit
ever reported for elite endurance athletes in the scientic
literature stggl and sperlich 2015. this contrasts with the
session distribution of 76816 litmithit observed in
trad and diers substantially from the 20 distribution of
hitsessions previously observed in elite endurance athletes
seiler 2010.
the major portion of hit sessions in bp were performed as
interval sessions with relatively short work duration typically
5  4 min  92 of hfmax while more of the longer
duration mit sessions typically 5  78 min  8792 were
employed in trad. physiological adaptations depend on both
intensity and accumulated duration of training. for example
accumulating 3045 min at 90 hrmax twice per week has
been found to be more eective than accumulating 1520 min
at 95 hrmax sandbakk et al. 2013 seiler et al. 2013. this
indicates that in our athlete who performed mit sessions at
around 90 of hrmax the eects of the higher number of hit
sessions in bp could have been compensated for by a higher
number of longduration mit sessions in trad.
we
found
opposite
patterns
in
the
distribution
and
progression of mit and hit across the phases of the
training year in the two periodization models. in bp the
amount of hit was already high in gp1 1.9 hwk with
a small reduction in sp 1.7 hwk and a further reduction
in cp 1.3 hwk. there was also a tendency for the
hit blocks to become shorter with fewer hit sessions
toward cp. in contrast the amount of hit was lowest
in gp1 0.4 hwk in trad then increased toward cp
1.2 hwk whereas the amount of mit showed the opposite
pattern. thus trad represents a gradual change to a more
polarized distribution with increased amounts of hit closer
to the desired peak performance. this is consistent with
previous observations in world class xc skiers and orienteers
tnnessen et al. 2014 2015.
the dierent progression in hit clearly represents diverse
training philosophies. interviews with the participant and her
coaches indicate that the hit blocks were aimed at enhancing
vo2max early in the preparation phase. this in order to facilitate
higher training velocities throughout gp and sp and thereby be
at a higher performance level as the cp approached. this is in
contrast to trad in which high volumes of lit during gp are
believed to provide an aerobic platform on which to build specic
adaptations in response to increased hit and optimization of
performance toward cp laursen 2010.
despite clearly dierent volumes and organization of hit
we found no dierence in the performance development from
the rst to the second phase of the competition season
within bp compared to trad. however a limitation of our
comparison of performance in bp vs. trad is that the
traditional model was utilized later in the athletes career when
she was more experienced and that the competition program
in xcskiing changed during the investigated period. further
studies are therefore needed to investigate performance outcomes

detailed description of the use of hit
blocks in bp
the present study is the rst to give detailed insights into
successful use of hit blocks across an annual cycle in a world
class endurance athlete. of the 157 hit sessions performed in bp
73 sessions were organized during the hit blocks representing
45 of annual hit volume and sessions. specically seven hit
blocks with a duration of 711 days including 813 hit sessions
were performed from gp1 to sp. with such a high density of hit
sessions a challenge is the short recovery time and a subsequent
risk of accumulation of fatigue from sessions targeting the same
systems. this challenge was indeed the case for our participant
where the average frequency of hit sessions was 8 sessions over
a 7 days period with 13 days that included two hit sessions
performed on the same day. although gradual fatigue over the
period was sometimes the case interviews with the participant
indicate that she was mostly able to maintain a relatively high
training quality throughout the hit blocks including when two
hit sessions were performed on the same day. in contrast yeo
et al. 2008 reported the power output produced by endurance
trained athletes to be lower during a second session of hit
performed on the same day compared to a separate day. reduced
hr during maximal exercise has also been demonstrated in
competitive cyclists following a period of training predominantly
consisting of hit jeukendrup et al. 1992. however in the
study by mcgawley et al. 2017 the authors found no dierence
in either time in hr zones or distance covered resulting from
performing nine vs. three hit sessions a week.
an important point in this context is that xc skiers
alternate between several exercise modes in their training.
during hit blocks the participant utilized ve dierent exercise
modes including specic classic and skating technique on
skis or rollerskis semispecic double poling or running
with poles and nonspecic running exercise modes. this
micro periodization of dierent exercise modes with dierential
loading of the upper and lower body is likely very important
in maintaining the quality of sessions as well as avoiding
muscular fatigue throughout the hit blocks. furthermore
both the participant and her coaches reported that the
hit sessions during blocks were closely supervised with a
focus on a progressive increase in speed from the start of
the sessions allowing hr to gradually approach the target
intensity zone without increasing the velocity further when
target hr 92 of hrmax was reached. her coaches
stated that after completing the last interval of a hit
session the athlete should potentially be able to perform one
additional interval at approximately the same pace. this precise
steering of intensity is critical and diers from studies that
investigate hit protocols when performing hit sessions at
the maximum sustainable intensity during all interval bouts
socalled isoeort matching sylta et al. 2016. in the current
case the precise steering of intensity during hit sessions likely
contributed to a reduced recovery time thereby increasing
the participants ability to perform the high frequency of
hit sessions at high quality and tolerate the overall training
load during blocks.
only a minor dierence in the number of illness days or
periods was found between bp and trad in our study. however
intensied training or frequent competitions have previously
been associated with negative changes in immunological variables
and more illness incidents tiollier et al. 2005 papacosta and
nassis 2011 li et al. 2012 svendsen et al. 2015 2016. another
concern regarding the use of hit blocks is the reduction in
wellbeing and increased stress levels jeukendrup et al. 1992
halson et al. 2002 jurimae et al. 2004 coutts et al. 2007.
therefore the high stress induced by hit blocks might increase
the risk of longterm performance decline overtraining or
nonfunctional overreaching when stress and recovery is not
suciently balanced meeusen et al. 2013. to prevent this our
participant had a reduction in training load after each hit block
and clearly reduced the amount of hit sessions between blocks.
we speculate that this was the main reason for the low number of
sickness days as well as her high motivation for training in both
seasons analyzed.
the participant had progressively increased her training
load since junior level and was in a highly trained state
when she started the relatively extreme use of hit blocks
presented here solli et al. 2017. this as well as her
balanced microperiodization of hit blocks made her able to
tolerate high loads of hit increasing her performance rapidly
during the rst 23 years utilizing this periodization model.
however it should be noted that her performance stagnated
during the following years. in retrospect both the participant
and her coaches agree that block periodization of hit was
eective during the rst seasons 20042006 but that they
subsequently should have changed the training to focus more
on maintaining the increased capacity and targeting other
performancerelated factors. this coincides with the participants
next major performance improvement in 2010 solli et al.
2017 including a change to a traditional model presented
in the current study. therefore it could be stated that block
periodization of hit is eective in inducing rapid performance
improvements but has some limitations and risks in respect to
longterm utilization.
limitations
the main limitation of this study is that bp and trad were
carried out with almost 10 years between them so that eects
of training history might dier between the two periodization
models examined for this specic athlete. although the etl
was similar in the two investigated years dierences in content
intensity distribution duration and frequency of sessions clearly
diered. when interpreting our results it is hence important
to be aware of the integrated eects of both inclusion of hit
blocks and dierences in overall training content. in addition
the development of xcskiing and changes in the competition
program makes it dicult to directly compare the performance
development throughout the investigated years. unfortunately
no test data was available for bp that could have allowed more
detailed analyses of the development of performance indicators
frontiers in physiology  
april 2019  volume 10  article 375
solli et al.
block vs. traditional periodization of hit
throughout the annual cycle. furthermore the main focus in
this study was to compare the training organization and content
between bp and trad and other components important for
the training outcome such as physical characteristics abilities
mentality lifestyle and nutrition are not discussed here. still this
study provides unique insights into how relatively extreme hit
blocks are managed in a worldclass athlete and how this diers
for the same athlete using a traditional model.
practical applications
this study shows that block periodization of hit was successfully
utilized in a world class xcskier. in particular we highlight
the importance of balanced microperiodization during hit
blocks by utilizing dierent exercise modes careful steering
of intensity and reductions in the training load and amount
of hit after each block. in addition the periodization model
must be adjusted to the athletes training status and the risk of
negative overreaching and stress on the immunological system
must be considered. however the participant also achieved
substantial success using a traditional model which might
be considered a safer model. we hope that our study can
highlight the importance of tailoring training to each individual
athlete based on training history and other factors inuencing
adaptation to training.
conclusion
this study provides novel insights into successful utilization of
two dierent periodization models by the worldleading xc skier
of our time. despite similar etl a higher training volume due to
more mit and long duration lit sessions was found in trad.
in contrast twice as many hitsessions were performed in bp
which is among the highest volumes of hit ever reported for
elite endurance athletes. this high hit volume was achieved by
organizing 45 of the annual hit sessions across seven hit
blocks varying from 7 to 11 days with each block including 813
hit sessions. the progression and distribution of hit diered
clearly between periodization models bp included high amounts
of hit already from the rst preparation period followed
by a reduction toward cp while trad had a progressive
increase in hit toward the cp. altogether this study illustrates
two successful ways of periodizing endurance training in a
world class athlete.
