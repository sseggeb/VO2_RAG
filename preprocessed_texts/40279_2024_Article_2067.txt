abstract
background  our scientific understanding of the mechanistic and practical connections between training session prescrip
tions their execution by athletes and adaptations over time in elite endurance sports remains limited. these connections are 
fundamental to the art and science of coaching.
objective  by using successful norwegian endurance coaches as key informants the aim of this study is to describe and 
compare best practice session models across different exercise intensities in olympic endurance sports.
methods  data collection was based on a fourstep pragmatic qualitative study design involving questionnaires training 
logs from successful athletes and indepth and semistructured interviews followed by negotiation among researchers and 
coaches to assure our interpretations. twelve successful and experienced male norwegian coaches from biathlon cross
country skiing longdistance running road cycling rowing speed skating swimming and triathlon were chosen as key 
informants. they had been responsible for the training of worldclass endurance athletes who altogether have won  370 
medals in international championships.
results  the duration of lowintensity training lit sessions ranges from 30 min to 7 h across sports mainly due to modality
specific constraints and load tolerance considerations. crosstraining accounts for a considerable part of lit sessions in 
several sports. moderate mit and highintensity training hit sessions are mainly conducted as intervals in specific 
modalities but competitions also account for a large proportion of annual hit in most sports. interval sessions are character
ized by a high accumulated volume a progressive increase in intensity throughout the session and a controlled rather than 
exhaustive execution approach. a clear trend towards shorter intervals and lower work rest ratio with increasing intensity 
was observed. overall the analyzed sports implement considerably more mit than hit sessions across the annual cycle.
conclusions  this study provides novel insights on quantitative and qualitative aspects of training session models across 
intensities employed by successful athletes in olympic endurance sports. the interval training sessions revealed in this 
study are generally more voluminous more controlled and less exhaustive than most previous recommendations outlined 
in research literature.

key points 
this study describes training session models across 
intensities applied by worldleading coaches in endur
ance sports.
training session models vary substantially across sports 
mainly due to load tolerance considerations for the 
locomotion modality seasonal circumstances and sport
specific demands.
the interval training session models outlined here are 
more voluminous more controlled and less exhaustive 
than recommendations from many published interven
tion studies.
1  introduction
numerous studies published over the last  25 years have 
quantified the training characteristics of elite endurance ath
letes in which annual training volumes range from  500 
to  1200 h per year distributed across 300600 training 
sessions 129. this large variation among equally suc
cessful performers is mainly explained by modalityspecific 
constraints e.g. weightbearing versus nonweight bearing 
sports type of muscle action involved cyclemusclecon
traction time and legdominant versus wholebody exer
cise although individual predispositions also matter 27. 
depending on the specific quantification approach i.e. cat
egorizing the distribution of whole sessions versus minute
forminute time in zone about 8090 of endurance train
ing is performed at low intensity below the first lactate or 
ventilatory turn point while the remaining 1020 is per
formed at higher intensity 2 7 14 18 22. while the inter
action between training volume and intensity distribution 
is well described at an annual and monthly level in rowing 
15 crosscountry xc skiing 7 8 2426 road cycling 
912 longdistance running 1316 2023 swimming 
1719 and triathlon 2729 corresponding information 
for prescription and execution of individual endurance train
ing sessions are sparse.
training prescription for continuous exercise sessions 
include selection of exercise modality working duration and 
intensity while interval training also encompasses manipula
tion of number of repetitions number of series relief interval 
intensity and duration and the betweenseries recovery dura
tion and intensity 31. ironically interval training sessions 
are often described in more detail compared with continuous 
exercise training 2 20 31 although the latter training form 
by far constitutes the largest proportion of training in elite 
endurance athletes.
session model comparisons across studies and sports are 
complicated because of inconsistent methodological frame
works e.g. intensity zones and terminology. moreover most 
of the research within this topic has been conducted on well
trained but nonelite volunteers who perform training sessions 
that may not be consistent with what elite endurance athletes 
perform 31. detailed training session descriptions have been 
presented for worldleading longdistance runners and xc ski
ers 2026. these studies show large betweensport differ
ences in duration for lowintensity training lit and partly 
also for moderateintensity training mit sessions while 
the summated duration for highintensity training hit ses
sions appear more consistent. corresponding training session 
descriptions for sports such as road cycling swimming tri
athlon rowing biathlon and speed skating are clearly under
represented or missing. due to the large variations in annual 
training volume across endurance sports 30 it is reasonable 
to expect large variations in training session prescriptions as 
well.
indeed more research is needed to improve our under
standing of session model features among elite endur
ance sports. the very best practitioners are often years 
ahead of sport science in integrating the critical features 
of training 2 16 22 and experienced coaches who have 
achieved success with multiple athletes over time are 
likely best capable to describe good session designs and 
identify factors ensuring high training consistency and 
quality 32 33. surprisingly the practices knowledge 
and experience of the very best endurance sport coaches 
have received minimal attention in research literature.
norway has been one of the worldleading sport 
nations per capita in the last two to three decades 34 
with most olympic and world championships medals 
won in endurance sports such as xc skiing biathlon 
speed skating rowing cycling swimming longdistance 
running and triathlon. one of the advantages of the 
norwegian system is that endurance sports use the same 
framework for defining training content facilitating valid 
comparisons across sports. by using successful norwe
gian endurance coaches as key informants the aim of this 
study is to describe and compare best practice session 
models across different training intensities in olympic 
endurance sports. within this context we define endur
ance sports as disciplines with  6 min competition dura
tion with an aerobic energy contribution of     85.
2  methods
2.1  study design
this study is a part of a larger project investigating success
ful coaches in olympic endurance sports where the overall 
best practice training session models in endurance sports
aim is to gain comprehensive insights regarding the holistic 
training philosophies and practices at the macro meso and 
microlevel. for the current study a pragmatic multiple case 
study design was used to investigate best practice session 
models successfully used to attain worldclass performance 
in olympic endurance sports. to investigate the complex
ity and capture sportspecific dimensions and perspectives 
the following cases were selected xc skiing biathlon 
swimming longdistance running longtrack speed skat
ing hereafter referred to as speed skating rowing road 
cycling and triathlon. to allow for comparison and contrast 
across sports all cases were selected within norway assum
ing similar culture and context. some of the most successful 
and experienced coaches were chosen as key informants.
2.2  participants
twelve male norwegian coaches participated in this study. 
they were all currently or previously responsible for the 
training of worldclass endurance athletes who altogether 
have won more than 370 olympic world and european 
championship medals mainly with norwegian athletes. all 
coaches had experience of coaching both males and females. 
two coaches were involved in xc skiing biathlon swim
ming triathlon and longdistance running while one coach 
was involved in speed skating rowing and road cycling. 
one informant coached both swimming and triathlon ath
letes. annual training volume measures prescribed by the 
coaches in these sports are presented in table 1. all the 
coaches provided a written informed consent to participate 
prior to the study and approved the manuscript prior to sub
mission. the regional committee for medical and health 
research ethics waived the requirement for ethical approval 
for this study and the ethics of the project was performed 
according to the institutional requirements at the school of 
health sciences kristiania university college. approval for 
data security and handling was obtained from the norwegian 
centre for research data reference no. 605672.
2.3  procedures
inspired by the key informant technique in ethnographic 
research a pragmatic fourstep procedure was used to col
lect and qualityassure comprehensive information on best 
practice regarding key session models across different endur
ance sports
1.	 initially an extensive questionnaire related to planning 
conducting and evaluation of training at the macro 
meso micro and session level was administered to all 
coaches.
2.	 the next step consisted of qualityassurance of data 
through conversations with the coaches and crossref
erencing with historically reported training logs from 
some of their most successful athletes.
3.	 thereafter a semistructured interview was conducted 
with each coach by the first and second authors to obtain 
supplementary information related to the qualitative 
aspects of session models among elite endurance sports. 
within this context training quality is defined as the 
degree of excellence related to how the training process 
or training sessions are executed to optimize adaptations 
andor improve overall performance 33. each inter
view lasted approximately 180 min of which about one
third was directly related to this study. the interviews 
were audio recorded and transcribed. formal translation 
and back translation from norwegian to english were 
performed by the first and third author respectively.
4.	 during analysis we involved the coaches in an extensive 
review process and followup interviews to clarify and 
ensure that the findings reflected their perspectives on 
best practice training sessions as accurately as possible.
in terms of endurance training intensity quantification a 
sixzone scale developed by the norwegian top sport cen
tre table 2 was applied. modified versions of this scale 
have been used in several previous studies 3537. training

zone determination during practice was determined by the 
coaches based on a holistic interpretation of all the included 
metrics listed in table 2. moreover a modified session goal 
approach based on sylta et al. 36 was employed. that is 
training intensity distribution was described in terms of 
the categorical distribution of prescribed training sessions 
across intensity zones based on their execution. in compari
son with a timeinzone approach that will overemphasize 
lit this method presents a more representative picture of 
mit and lit prescription within longterm programming. 
here only the main part of the session was considered 
while warmup and cool down were excluded. we use the 
term accumulated work duration awd for interval ses
sions and this is defined as the summated duration of the 
work bouts only.
for the purpose of this study cross training was defined 
as endurance training in a nonspecific mode. treadmill run
ning including antigravity treadmill running roller ski
ing roller skating ergometer rowing and indoor cycling 
were considered specific i.e. not cross training for runners 
crosscountry skiersbiathletes speed skaters rowers and 
cyclists respectively.
2.4  analyses
numerical information on training session organization 
across intensity zones was systematized in microsoft excel 
microsoft corporation redmond wa for descriptive 
presentations. thereafter this information was compared 
with information from training diaries of successful athletes 
in the respective sports and calibrated among the authors 
and coaches.
to identify similarities and differences within and across 
endurance sports summaries of common sessionmodel 
features across endurance sports and sportspecific features 
related to planning and execution of training sessions were 
outlined.
3  results
table 2 presents commonly applied training session mod
els across intensity zones among norwegian worldleading 
athletes in olympic endurance sports while table 3 pro
vides an overview of how the loading factors are typically 
organized across intensity zones within the same sports. 
overall lit sessions account for approximately 7580 
of all sessions. these are dominated by continuous exer
cise although swimming rowing speed skating and road 
cycling also apply lowintensive intervals. athletes from 
all disciplines surveyed performed the vast majority of 
lit sessions in z1 and only to a limited extent in z2. the 
duration of typical continuous lit sessions spans from 
30 to 420 min across sports with longdistance running 
on the lower end and road cycling on the upper end of 
the scale. longdistance running road cycling swimming 
and triathlon perform most lit sessions in the specific 
modalities while nonspecific crosstraining accounts for 
a considerable proportion of total lit sessions in speed 
skating rowing biathlon and xc skiing.
mit sessions i.e. z3 account for approximately 
1015 of all sessions across the annual cycle. these are 
mainly performed as intervals although with large sport
specific variations. awd is in the range of 2090 min 
and interval times are mainly in the range 520 min while 
worktorest ratio is mainly in the range 641 tables 3 
and 4. biathlon xc skiing road cycling and swimming 
also apply continuous work in z3 with accumulated work 
duration in the range 4060 min. in several sports particu
larly road cycling competitions account for a considerable 
part of the overall z3 volume.
hit sessions comprise about 510 of all sessions and 
are mainly conducted as intervals and competitions in all 
sports. awd is in the range 1550 min for z4 1030 min 
for z5 and 315 min for z67 warmup and cool down 
not included while work bout durations are in the range 
110 min from 30 s to 7 min and from 20 s to 3 min 
respectively table 3 and 4. worktorest ratio is in the 
range 321 for z4 211 for z5 and 10.11 for z67 but 
sportspecific differences are clearly present. competitions 
account for a considerable part of z45 work among elite 
athletes as most sports have at least 1520 competition 
days per year table 1.
most coaches reported applying a limited set of ses
sion models within each zone for weektoweek calibra
tioncontrol of performance development. within these 
sessions several common features were identified across 
endurance sports that are described in detail in table 5. 
these include the application of hardeasy rhythmicity

by 1020 min skating imitation exercises four to six skating rounds on track with progressive intensity z14 and 24  3040 s skating in z56. swimmers typically perform 1530 min of 
landbased mobility exercises with and without rubber bands 1520 min progressive swimming in z13 and finally 35  510 s swimming sprints. rowers typically perform 2030 min 
ergometer cycling or rowing in z12 and 1020 min rowing on water in z13 followed by two to three repetitions of accelerated rowing sprints. cool downs for most sports typically consist of 
2030 min z21 i.e. regressive work in a specific modality except for speed skaters and rowers who perform 3060 min cycling in z1
in xc skiing most athletes train around 50 in the skating and 50 in the classic style. all ski sessions for xc and biathlon can also be performed on roller skies. in biathlon all z34 sessions 
can include shooting during the rest intervals. specific rowing sessions can be performed on a rowing ergometer. similarly specific speedskating sessions can be performed on roller skates. 
the running sessions for triathletes can be performed on paveddirt roads or rubberized track

4  discussion
this is the first study to describe and compare training ses
sion models across intensities and endurance sports. the 
duration of lit sessions varies substantially across sports 
ranging from 30 min to 7 h mainly due to modalityspecific 
constraints and load tolerance considerations while mit 
and hit sessions differ less across sports and are mainly 
conducted as intervals or competitions in specific modali
ties. overall both mit and hit interval sessions are char
acterized by a high awd a progressive increase in intensity 
throughout the session and a controlled rather than exhaus
tive execution approach. in the following paragraphs we 
will discuss the quantitative and qualitative aspects of these 
session models and potential underlying mechanisms in 
more detail.
this study clearly demonstrates that lit is the most pre
scribed type of training session in elite endurance sport in 
line with previous studies based on quantification of training 
performed 2 7 13 14 18 22 38. most lit sessions are 
prescribed and executed in z1 interspersed with z2 once
totwice per week or as part of progressive z1sessions. 
this distinct feature would not have been detected by the 
commonly applied threezone scale lit mit and hit 
emphasizing the advantage of a more categorized scale e.g. 
a sixzone scale as in this study. in this context it is impor
tant to emphasize that elite endurance athletes have a broad 
intensity range below the first lactate turn point compared 
with recreational and moderately trained performers. this 
makes the potential range of intensity and duration com
binations within lit larger for elite athletes and a more 
important programming consideration for their coaches. one 
might speculate that z2 training costs too much for elite 
endurance athletes making them less recovered and poorer 
prepared for the subsequent intensive sessions. accord
ing to several of the present coaches z2 training is mainly 
implemented for technical reasons as an effective force sig
nature in the movement cycle sometimes requires a mini
mum speed or power output. some of the analyzed sports 
perform lit as long intervals to provide short intermissions 
for nutritionfueling technical feedback and lactate meas
urements. however since the latter intervals are quite long 
and the intermittent recoveries are relatively short such 
sessions practically act as continuous lit sessions from a 
perceptual and physiological perspective. similarly terrain 
variations in sports such as biathlon and xcskiing make 
lit sessions more stochastic 39 40. the prevailing notion 
is that most lit sessions must be sufficiently easy to ensure 
that the subsequent hard sessions can be conducted with suf
ficient quality. lit sessions have misguidedly been termed 
recovery workouts by several practitioners over the years 
22 suggesting that these sessions do not elicit adaptations 
themselves but rather accelerate recovery prior to the next 
hard session. we argue that this interpretation is erroneous 
for two important reasons. first the concept of any form 
of recovery acceleration from an intervening workout lacks 
support in the scientific literature although the low load 
of such sessions likely causes limited interference with the 
ongoing recovery process. second frequent and voluminous 
lit is considered an important stimulus for inducing periph
eral aerobic adaptations 41 and improving work economy 
42 43. at least three adaptive signaling pathways through 
which exercise of different intensities and durations can 
impact protein composition of working muscle over time 
have welldemonstrated signaling roles mediated through 
specific kinases and aggregated by the pgc1a gene 44. 
the pathways triggered by high energy phosphate depletion 
i.e. large reductions in atpamp ratio and by elevated 
production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species both 
show rapidly evolving feedback inhibition of signal ampli
tude as signal mediated adaptations occur 4547. that is 
adaptive feedback inhibition reduces the adaptive return 
from these pathways with repeated hit bouts over time. in 
contrast it appears that elevated intracellular calcium con
centration associated with the excitationcontraction cou
pling process remain responsive across longer training time 
frames due to greater potential for modulation via exercise 
duration  intensity interaction with essentially no feedback 
inhibition of the primary signal within and across motor 
units. accordingly it may seem that years of accumulated 
wisdom among elite coaches is consistent with how different 
signaling pathways coalesce to determine the overall adap
tive enrichment of the endurance phenotype.
notably awd for lit sessions varies markedly both 
within and across sports. withinsport differences are mainly 
explained by session purpose i.e. extralong versus short 
longslow distance while betweensport differences were 
explained by competitionspecific demands movement 
constraints for the modality and associated loadtolerance 
best practice training session models in endurance sports
table 5   common sessionmodel features across endurance sports
common features
descriptions
hardeasy rhythmicity
days of hard workouts i.e. interval training or extralong slowdistance sessions are 
systematically alternated with days of easy lowintensity training in between. most 
coaches advocate two to three hard training days so called key sessions per week 
during the preparation period e.g. tuesdays thursdays and saturdays
double intensive sessions
a total of 7 out of the 13 interviewed coaches practice double intensive sessions i.e. 
intervals both in the morning and afternoon session of the same day. the main 
purpose is to increase the total volume of intensive training while managing recov
ery cycles and stress load. in longdistance running swimming and triathlon this 
approach is applied in z3 sessions. rowing and speed skating apply double intensive 
sessions in z46 to increase the amount of training around race pace
crosstraining
most sports apply crosstraining mainly in z1 to achieve sufficient total train
ing volume although in varying degrees. training sessions in z35 are mainly 
conducted in a specific modality except for speed skating xc skiing and biathlon 
who perform crosstraining systematically also at these intensities only z3 for speed 
skating. a common notion among the coaches is that crosstraining modality must 
bear sufficient physiological and mechanical resemblances to the specific demands to 
maximize the odds for positive adaptations
few session models
most coaches apply a limited set of session models within each zone for predictability 
and weektoweek calibrationcontrol purposes
mostly controlled very few allout sessions
very few hard sessions competitions not included across the annual cycle are 
conducted to complete exhaustion but rather with a reps in reserve approach. the 
main purpose with this approach is to increase the accumulated working volume 
at high but not too high intensities and ensure that the athletes are sufficiently 
recovered for the next key session. allout sessions which are very similar to the 
competitionspecific demands are only performed the last 36 weeks prior to the 
main competition of the macrocycle. elite coaches seek sustainability and optimiza
tion through session programming not maximization
progressive intensity increases throughout the sessions most hard sessions are performed with a slight progressive increase in intensity. the 
difference between the first and last interval may be 0.5 kmh during running inter
vals and 1025 w during cycling intervals. similarly continuous longslow distance 
sessions typically start at the lower end of the intensity zone then gradually increase 
to the mid or upper end of the zone as the session progresses
combination of intensity zones
table 1 presents the most used sessions models within each intensity zone. however 
the coaches also implement sessions that combine training intensities. combinations 
of z12 z34 and z45 are most often applied
altitude training
most coaches advocate altitude training. altitude sessions are conducted with lower 
speedpower output compared to sealevel sessions leading to lower neuromuscular 
loading. during altitude interval sessions mainly z34 the recovery periods tend 
to be somewhat longer than corresponding sessions at sea level to avoid accumula
tion of fatigue and keep the intensity at the desired level
tapering strategies and easy weeks
during tapering or easy training weeks about 50 shorter session duration than those 
presented in table 1 are advocated. the main intention with such sessions is to 
decrease the cumulative effects of fatigue while maintaining fitnesscapacity
passive recoveries
most coaches apply passive recoveries between intervals. active recoveries are mainly 
used for training organizationlogistic purposes
coachs focus prior to the sessions
the coaches spend considerable time on planning optimal sessions often in coopera
tion with the athletes. the training content of key sessions is typically presented 
17 days in advance to facilitate athletes mental preparations
coachs focus during the sessionss
the main focus during interval sessions is to provide technical feedbackguidance 
modify training load variables when necessary and assist the athletes with intensity 
control lactate samples timingpower output assessments etc.. similar focus is 
present on lowintensive sessions although less frequent measurements for intensity 
control purposes are applied. lactate samples are considered more important than 
speedpower output for developing the athletes inner feeling of intensity
coachs focus after the sessions
most coaches practice debriefing and recapitulation of each session together with the 
athletes to pinpoint what worked well and features for improvements. the main 
intention is to create an arena for learning and enhance training quality for subse
quent sessions
e. tnnessen et al.
table 6   sportspecific features related to planning and execution of training sessions
sport
specific features
biathlon
biathletes perform considerable amounts of crosstraining in the form of cycling and running particularly during the preparation 
period when access to snow is limited
the intensity demands during competitions vary according to terrain variations and biathletes apply subtechniques optimized 
for different speedincline combinations. hence most roller skiinterval sessions are conducted in competitionspecific terrain 
with combinations of intensity zones
z1 sessions are mainly conducted in the lower part of the zone particularly during running and cycling sessions. however long
slow distance sessions may drift to z2 during uphill skiing to ensure proper technique
interval sessions are often performed in combination with shooting during the recovery periods. five intervals are often applied 
to ensure equal amount of shooting in the standing and prone position. here warmup shots close to resting state are performed 
in advance for preparation purposes
xcskiing
xc skiers perform considerable amounts of crosstraining e.g. running with or without poles on soft terrain during the prepara
tion period where access to snow is limited
the intensity demands during competitions vary according to terrain variations and xcskiers apply subtechniques optimized 
for different speedincline combinations. hence most roller skiinterval sessions are conducted in competitionspecific terrain 
with
combinations of intensity zones
z1 sessions are mainly conducted in the lower part of the zone particularly during running sessions. however longslow dis
tance sessions may drift to z2 during uphill skiing to ensure proper technique
ld running
longdistance runners generally apply shorter session models than other endurance sports particularly z13 and this is mainly 
explained by the high mechanical loading demands
much of the accumulated running kilometres in z13 sessions is undertaken with cushioned shoes on forgiving surfaces dirt 
roadsforest paths instead of paved roads to reduce mechanical loading and maximize training volume. the higher the inten
sity and the closer to the competition season the more running sessions are undertaken on rubberized track with spike shoes
crosstraining sessions are mainly applied as alternative training during injury rehabilitation periods but some athletes perform 
crosstraining sessions to cope with the high total training volume during the preparation period
treadmill running sessions are preferred when weatherwinter conditions are poor rain snow ice and for intensity control 
particularly during z3 sessions
z1 sessions are mainly conducted in the upper part of the zone and sometimes in z2 to ensure proper running technique
road cycling
because of the long competition duration and the notion that cycling is a gentle locomotion modality with low injury risk disre
garding falls and crashes most sessions are in the range 36 h
most intensive sessions are performed as competitions most road cyclists compete 5070 days per year. however each race is 
characterized by a broad range of intensities depending on the type of competition mass starts versus time trials singleday 
races versus. stage races hilly versus flat terrain etc. and role within the team captain versus domestiques climbers versus 
sprinters etc.
most of the remaining intensive training beside competitions is integrated in lit sessions e.g. cycling uphill or cycling with 
reduced drag
rowing
considerable amounts of crosstraining sessions in the form of cycling summer or xcskiing winter are performed to achieve 
sufficient total training volume. moreover warmups and cool downs in conjunction with ergometer rowing interval sessions 
involve cycling or xcskiing depending on season
speed training is integrated in rowingspecific longslow distance or interval sessions 23 times per week to improve acceleration 
or top speed
speed skating because an effective skating position is muscularly demanding over time inducing local fatigue back pain etc. long skating 
sessions are challenging to perform. moreover the restricted access to ice in norway during the summer season further reduces 
the number of skatingspecific sessions. therefore most low and moderateintensity sessions z13 consist of road cycling 
while most highintensive sessions are performed on skates. the cycling training increases the tolerance for more frequent 
intensive or longer skating sessions. cycling is also preferred during warmups and cool down in conjunction with intensive 
skating sessions to fully utilize the limited ice access and to provide an aerobic stimulus
speedskating intervals z4 are typically performed in small groups mostly two to four but sometimes eight to ten athletes to 
reduce air drag and thereby increase the speed. however competitionspecific speed training mainly z5 is normally practiced 
individually for intensity control purposes
because speedskating is muscularly demanding longer interval recoveries are applied in speedskating sessions compared to 
corresponding sessions in other locomotion modalities and sports

considerations. the latter aspect is in line with sandbakk 
et al. 30 who recently developed a theoretical framework 
for the impact of physiological and biomechanical mecha
nisms associated with different locomotion modalities on 
training load management in endurance exercise. according 
to their theory the combination of weightbearing exercise 
and rapid plyometric power production in longdistance run
ning puts high loads on muscles and tendons during each 
step likely explaining why the duration of lit sessions in 
longdistance running is relatively low compared to most 
other endurance sports. however elite runners seem to com
pensate for this low volume by training twice a day and 
performing some of the lit sessions in the upper range of 
z1 sometimes approaching z2 22.
speed skating is also muscularly demanding but for other 
reasons. the small angles in the hip and knee in addition 
to the static upper body position and long duty cycle of an 
effective skating stroke together induce intermittent blood
flow restrictions in the working muscles 6 48. hence 
speed skaters typically prefer cycling instead of the skating
specific modality during lit and mit sessions as well as 
for warmups and cool downs. nils van der poel double gold 
medalist in the 2022 beijing winter olympics followed this 
approach to the extreme with 67 h rides on the bike five 
times per week during preparation training and considerable 
amounts of mit cycling in the subsequent phase 49.
road cyclists perform longer but fewer training sessions 
compared with the other sports. the preference for and 
tolerance of voluminous road cycling sessions can mainly 
be explained by the concentric only and nonweight bear
ing loading the longduration competition format and the 
fact that cyclists draft behind teammatescompetitors and 
coast downhill in substantial parts of the sessions. care
ful examination of elite cyclists reveals that 1020 of all 
cycling sessions are spent at a power output  0.75 wkg 
10. while a runner absorbs a huge mechanical load when 
running downhill a cyclist coasting downhill is normally 
resting the active musculature.
swimming also involves nonweightbearing exercise and 
low contraction velocity movement 30. swimmers perform 
shorter lit sessions than road cyclists. to obtain a relatively 
high training volume these athletes seem to compensate by 
consistently swimming twice a day with the first session 
performed in the early morning. this approach can at least 
partly be explained by restricted access to swimming halls 
in the middle of the day as school swimming is generally 
prioritized by local authorities. interestingly in contrast 
to their highvolume training most swimming events are

specific features
swimming
interval training is performed across all intensity zones and continuous work is rarely applied. however the interval recover
ies in z12 sessions are very short so such sessions bare great resemblances to continuous longslow distance sessions. the 
application of lowintensive interval sessions is mainly for nutritionfuelling purposes providing technical feedback and taking 
lactate measurements
crawl is the main stroke for longdistance swimmers during practically all moderate to highintensive sessions. other strokes 
may be used during z12 work but never constituting more than 3040 of the total swimming time. the closer to the compe
tition season the higher the proportion of crawl swimming
special equipment e.g. boards zoomers and paddles is sometimes used during z12 sessions for technical development pur
poses to increase stroke power output or to reduce the load during lowintensive swimming
separate z12 leg sets are sometimes conducted for technical development purposes or development of aerobic capacity
running is occasionally used at crosstraining in z1 and z3 sessions during the preparation period but also as warmup to swim
ming sessions
to avoid logistic challenges in crowded pools swimmers apply slot times instead of recovery times e.g. athlete 1 starts at 
000 100 200 etc. while athlete 2 starts at 015 115 215 min
broken is a common method for z5intervals. here the competition discipline e.g. 800 or 1500 m is broken down to shorter 
intervals e.g. 100 m. the aim is to swim the intervals at race pace with short recovery periods in between. the closer to the 
competition season the shorter the recovery periods
triathlon
because triathlon consists of swimming road cycling and running combined sessions so called brick workouts are frequently 
applied to manage modality transitions. swimmingcycling or cyclingrunning are combined for physiological adaptation 
purposes and efficient change of equipment footwear and outfit. moreover athletes try out fuelnutrition intake during such 
sessions to optimize individual competition routines
the cycling part of the triathlon competition consists of many tight turns accompanied with decelerations and subsequent accel
erations. to cope with these demands cycling intervals are implemented with brief 510 s sprints every 12 min to simulate 
the competitionspecific situation
it is considered crucial to be up near the front in the initial swimming part of the triathlon competitions as it costs a lot of energy 
to pass competitors in a crowded openwater swim. hence elite triathletes practice fast starts in many swimming interval ses
sions. for example the first 25 m of each 100 m interval are at considerably faster than race pace while the remaining 75 m of 
each interval are conducted at race pace
brick workouts are designed to simulate competitionspecific demands. because the competitionspecific intensity is between z3 
and 4 most brick sessions are performed at the same intensity. hence brick sessions in z3 and 4 do not differ considerably
e. tnnessen et al.
dramatically shorter in duration compared with road cycling 
and most other traditional endurance sport events.
rowing also involves nonweightbearing and low contrac
tion velocity movement but the injury risk of overloaded 
back and ribs particularly with modern cleaver rowing 
blades has led rowers to implement a larger proportion of 
lit as crosstraining 30. in xc skiing and biathlon the 
athletes distribute training time across varying subtech
niques while skiing on snow or using roller skis 7 8 25 
26. however the best athletes do not perform longer lit 
sessions than cyclists rowers or swimmers. this can be 
explained by the moderately high muscular loads of skiing 
uphill in addition to the strong focus on and accompanying 
strain associated with maintaining effective technique and 
appropriate switching between multiple subtechniques in 
complex movements 30.
this study shows that many of the best practitioners 
within endurance sports supplement their lit sessions in 
the specific modalities with crosstraining in line with pre
vious studies 1 7 8 25. the application of crosstraining 
differs substantially across sports not only for movement 
constraints and associated load management but also for sea
sonal reasons. because of the limited access to snow during 
the summer xc skiers and biathletes perform many run
ning and cycling sessions respectively. likewise rowers 
execute numerous landbased sessions as running cycling 
or xc skiing perhaps a distinctly norwegian crosstraining 
modality during the winter. other supporting arguments 
for crosstraining in research literature include injury pre
vention general central capacity effects and prevention of 
training monotony 50 51. a plausible question within this 
context is whether longdistance runners should compensate 
for their low volume compared with the other analyzed 
sports by adding more crosstraining sessions to maxi
mize the training stimulus with lower muscularmechanical 
load. however a common notion among the interviewed 
coaches was that crosstraining modality must bear suf
ficient physiological and mechanical resemblances to the 
specific demands to maximize the odds for positive adapta
tions table 5 in line with the principle of specificity 52. 
alternative locomotion modalities for runners e.g. cycling 
and xc skiing are less used in most cases limited to injury 
rehabilitation processes and may be too removed from the 
specific demands increasing the odds for maladaptations. 
running is also unique among endurance sports in that cycle 
frequencycadence does not and cannot be manipulated very 
much across a broad range of intensitiesspeeds. more spe
cifically the cadence may only increase 10 from lit to 
hit for a distance runner. for a rower or kayak paddler 
cadence can vary at least twofold from z1 to z5 with the 
force signature maintained relatively stable. these issues 
may partly explain why crosstraining in longdistance run
ning mainly is restricted to injury rehabilitation processes. 
overall the underlying mechanism of crosstraining remains 
poorly understood and future longitudinal studies should 
aim to explore the training transfer efficiency of varying 
types of crosstraining.
based on the large variations in lit session duration 
across the analyzed sports in this study it is reasonable to 
question wellestablished training load assessment tools 
such as training impulse trimp and session rating of per
ceived exertion session rpe. while these concepts only 
take training volume and intensity into account 5355 it 
seems clear that the choice of exercise modality influences 
effort beyond commonly applied external and internal load 
measurements. we argue that these methods are not valid 
for comparisons of training load across exercise modalities 
for example by comparing sports or when comparing the 
load across different modalities. foster et al. 56 have also 
indicated that session rpe is mode dependent but more 
studies are warranted to verify this feature.
intensive sessions in the form of mit and hit are con
sidered fundamental for performance progression by all the 
participating coaches in this study and the planning and 
implementation of training are mainly centered around such 
key sessions. most mit sessions are performed as inter
vals although several sports also apply continuous work. 
competitions account for parts of mit or as elements of 
lit and the stochasticity of many competition formats 
such as cycling and xc skiing results in some intensity 
undulation. a specific feature for triathlon is the applica
tion of combined modalities socalled brick workouts 
where swimmingcycling or cyclingrunning are frequently 
applied during mit sessions to manage modality transi
tions. overall the analyzed sports implement considerably 
more mit than hit sessions across the annual cycle. this 
strategy has been a part of the training philosophy in sev
eral norwegian endurance sports over the last two decades 
57. here a fundamental feature is the application of dou
ble threshold sessions i.e. both morning and afternoon 
twice a week with blood lactate concentrations in the range 
24.5 mmoll. marius bakken a former norwegian 5000 m 
record holder 1306 min is considered the originator of this 
concept and he has argued that z3 intervals particularly 
microintervals lasting only 4560 s allow for accumulation 
of work at faster and more race relevant running speeds than 
continuous training in the same lactatebased zone without 
the negative consequences of hit in the form of fatigue 
and subsequent recovery 57. half of the coaches in this 
study and numerous elite coaches worldwide have adopted 
double threshold sessions in their weekly preparation train
ing representing a novelty in the current training of elite 
endurance runners.
the hit sessions presented in this study are mainly con
ducted as intervals although competitions constitute a sub
stantial part of most sports. in road cycling elements of hit 
best practice training session models in endurance sports
are conducted during lit sessions. in triathlon z4 sessions 
are often conducted as brick workouts. overall a common 
and logical trend across all sports is that interval times and 
accumulated working duration for interval sessions decrease 
with increasing intensity. recovery time between intervals 
depends on interval time and intensity but we observed a 
clear trend towards lower worktorest ratio with increas
ing intensity. the variations in mit and hit session design 
across sports can mainly be explained by corresponding 
movement constraints and load management considerations 
as explained previously for lit sessions although the dif
ferences between sports diminish with increasing training 
intensity.
ever since the first studies on interval training were pub
lished in the 1960s 58 59 a plethora of research has been 
devoted to this topic. interestingly the best practice interval 
sessions described in the present paper differ considerably 
from most of the models tested in previous intervention 
studies that are the building blocks of current established 
scientific recommendations 20 31 60. first our analyzed 
sports perform interval sessions across a considerably wider 
intensity range compared with research literature. compre
hensive and highly cited review papers recommend athletes 
to reach at least 90 of their maximal oxygen uptake during 
interval sessions or  95 of the minimal velocitypower 
that elicits maximal oxygen uptake to elicit both maximal 
cardiovascular and peripheral adaptations 20 31 60. sec
ondly awd for interval sessions is also considerably lower 
in most scientific studies 31 60 than those presented here. 
fundamentally elite coaches use awd to adjust both stimu
lus and progression between intensity adjustments stair
step model far more than most recreational athletes and 
researchers who emphasize mainly intensity as a lever for 
managing the hit prescription. third the observed trend 
towards lower worktorest ratio with increasing intensity 
has not previously been established in scientific studies. 
however the predominant application of passive recover
ies is in line with recommendations from research literature 
as active recoveries can lower muscle oxygenation impair 
phosphocreatine resynthesis and thereby trigger anaerobic 
system engagement during the following effort 31.
another notable finding from this study is that very few 
interval sessions are performed to the point of power or 
pace failure. instead these sessions are characterized by 
an even pacing across bouts or even a small but progressive 
increase in intensity crossing through for example upper 
z3 to upper z4 a semiexhausting effort and high awd. 
importantly maintaining good technique i.e. avoiding tech
nical collapse and floundering near the end of work bouts 
is emphasized. some intervention studies have applied 
intervals with maximal sustainable work intensity aim
ing to achieve the highest possible average speed or power 
so called maximum session effort or isoeffort approach 
6163. the interviewed coaches argue that such an allout 
approach is not sustainable over time for several reasons. 
in a shortterm perspective an allout session execution 
approach can lead to an undesired and poorly timed peak
ing response provided that the recoveries between such hard 
sessions are sufficient. in a longtime perspective an allout 
approach limits the accumulated load of mit and hit due 
to shorter work time in single sessions and longer recovery 
time after sessions. concurrently this increases the odds 
for overtraining and burnout due to the physical and mental 
strain associated with such sessions. the best practition
ers are therefore especially cautious not to overuse allout 
intensive sessions or introduce them too early in the annual 
cycle 7 16 22 25 35 a notion in line with traditional 
periodization thinking 64. alternatively controlled and 
semiexhausting interval sessions may effectively stimulate 
adaptation through the interaction between high intensity 
and larger accumulated work that can be achieved before 
the onset of fatigue compared with an allout approach 61 
6567.
all the key informant coaches in this study consider train
ing quality highly important for performance development. 
here quality is not synonymous with intensity as often 
seen in popular science literature. instead training quality 
is defined as the degree of excellence related to how the 
training sessions are executed to optimize adaptations and
or improve overall performance 33 69. this includes the 
ability to optimize processes that affect the execution of 
training sessions in relation to the intended purpose. inten
sity discipline in relation to the training prescription is an 
example of this quality emphasis observed at the elite level. 
training quality can be developed and finetuned over time 
through optimal application of monitoring tools and good 
communication among the athlete coach and supporting 
staff. obtained information related to readiness exercise 
load and recovery state form a basis for subsequent decision 
making 69 and this is continuously subject to improve
ment through a circular learning process where planning 
execution and debriefingevaluation are the fundamental 
stages 33 68. the present coaches describe a culture of 
continuous learning and development through constructive 
interactions with the athletes.
although this study has described a variety of session 
models across sports the best practitioners tend to apply 
a limited set of session models within each zone. in this 
way each key session acts as a test where heart rate blood 
lactate concentration speedpower output and perceived 
fatigueexertion can be compared from week to week. the 
principle of control is a fundamental feature of elite sport 
to determine whether athletes adapt to the training identify 
individual responses monitor fatigue and accompanying 
need for recovery and minimize the probability of nonfunc
tional overreaching illness and injury 55 70. it is also 
e. tnnessen et al.
reasonable to assume that implementation of wellknown 
sessions increases the likelihood for increased training qual
ity. interestingly all coaches have primarily adjusted their 
training session models to the individual athlete and sport
specific demands rather than based solely on sex as previ
ously described more generally 71.
a distinct feature across all the analyzed sports in this 
study is the alternating rhythmicity of hard and easy work
outs. the legendary track and field coach bill bowerman 
popularized this concept in the 1960s 22. this was also 
a fundamental feature of matveyevs traditional periodi
zation model founded at the same time 64 with strong 
links to the principle of stimulus and response also known 
as the overcompensation or training adaptation principle. 
that is training stress leads to acute fatigue and damage to 
physiological structures and during the subsequent restitu
tion phase the organism does not only return to the original 
condition but overcompensates to be better prepared for the 
next stress. the larger the training stress the longer the res
titution time required 72. importantly many of the coaches 
regard the training day not only each session as the unit of 
stress being managed. therefore amplifying the intensive 
load during a planned high stress training day is more 
sustainable than adding an additional high stress training day 
to the microcycle. mit and hit both induce high stress par
ticularly given the high absolute intensities and associated 
metabolic flux of elite performers combined with the awd 
that is prescribed and executed. the present study together 
with other recently published studies shows that consecu
tive hard training days rarely occur and that the hardeasy 
rhythmicity also holds true for todays elite endurance prac
titioners 7 16 22 25 35. hard and easy sessions seem to 
stimulate a complex set of overlapping and complementary 
adaptations 73 74 justifying the systematic training inten
sity variation for performance development in endurance 
sports. overall we would argue that elite coaches use this 
daytoday rhythmicity to carefully manage and to a sub
stantial extent polarize training stress not work intensity 
to ensure that recovery is achieved. elite coaching is about 
managing the systemic cost of maintaining a high training 
frequency and volume and thereby a high adaptive signal. 
across sports the success of these elite coaches is quanti
fied in terms of longterm thinking and staying healthy and 
being able to do the work required for success.
some study limitations should be acknowledged. first 
it is likely that the present results are influenced by a nor
wegian group culture bias and other roads may also 
lead to rome. although the key informants in this study 
have coached numerous worldleading athletes they have 
also applied the same training system to several other less 
successful athletes. moreover the intensity scale outlined 
here table 2 has been used by norwegian elite endur
ance athletes over the last two decades. previous studies 
have presented several arguments to explain why standard
ized intensity zone systems are imperfect tools 2 16 22 
37. slight inconsistencies in awd within the same zone 
can be observed when comparing present findings with 
previous studies 16 22. inconsistencies across studies 
are expected because 1 the intensive zones are narrow 
i.e. small differences in heart rate blood lactate and 
rpe and 2 mithit sessions tend to overlap inten
sity zones. although intensity scales can be criticized for 
several reasons we argue that the potential error sources 
are outweighed by the improved communication among 
practitioners that a common scale facilitates.
finally we do not believe norwegian athletes are phys
iologically biased towards a genotype that is uniquely 
responsive to the training characteristics described here. 
more likely the norwegian endurance sport success is 
grounded on a culture which includes an appreciation for 
endurance. norwegian champions often describe an active 
childhood that included lots of hiking skiing cycling etc. 
just as a function of living. so relative to the size of the 
country we could argue that a large fraction of norwegian 
children has good local conditions for 1 sampling a variety 
of endurance sports and 2 meeting local coaches with a 
good understanding of the endurance training process.
5  conclusions
the unique training session templates presented here are 
derived from worldleading coaches whose athletes have 
won more than 350 medals in international championships. 
overall large variations in session loading factors were 
observed across sports although the differences diminish 
with increasing intensity. awd for lit sessions ranges from 
approximately 30 min to 7 h with differences being mainly 
explained by modalityspecific constraints and accompany
ing consequences for load tolerance. for the same reasons in 
addition to seasonal considerations several sports perform 
large amounts of lit using cross training. intensive sessions 
mit and hit are considered paramount for performance 
progression by all coaches and all sports perform consider
ably more mit than hit sessions across the annual cycle. 
although most intensive sessions are conducted as inter
vals competitions also account for a large proportion. best 
practice interval sessions are characterized by a controlled 
nonallout approach high awd and a slight progressive 
increase in intensity throughout. we also observed a trend 
towards lower worktorest ratio with increasing intensity.
