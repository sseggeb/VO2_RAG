abstract the dietary practices of athletes play a crucial role in shaping their body composition
influencing sports performance training adaptations and overall health. however despite the widely
acknowledged significance of dietary intake in athletic success there exists a gap in our understanding
of the intricate relationships between nutrition body composition and performance. furthermore
emerging evidence suggests that many athletes fail to adopt optimal nutritional practices which can
impede their potential achievements. in response this special issue seeks to gather research papers
that delve into athletes dietary practices and their potential impacts on body composition and sports
performance. additionally studies focusing on interventions aimed at optimizing dietary habits are
encouraged. this paper outlines the key aspects and points that will be developed in the ensuing
articles of this special issue.

1. introduction
the realm of sports performance represents a dynamic interplay of various factors
among which dietary practices and body composition stand as pivotal elements 1. in
this line the importance of nutrition in sports is well established with a growing body
of research underscoring its role in enhancing athletic performance improving recovery
and reducing the risk of injury and illness 2. however the onesizefitsall approach is
rapidly becoming obsolete as individualized nutrition strategies tailored to specific sports
physiological demands and personal health and fitness goals gain prominence 3.
body composition an athletes proportion of fat muscle and bone is another critical
factor in sports performance 4. the relationship between body composition and perfor
mance is complex and sport specific 5. for instance while leaner body composition may
benefit endurance athletes sports requiring explosive power or strength may necessitate a
higher muscle mass 6. this special issue aims to dissect these relationships providing
insights into how athletes can optimize their body composition for their specific sporting de
mands. furthermore this special issue addresses the nutritional requirements for different

sports. the energy and nutrient needs of an athlete vary significantly across different sports
disciplines. endurance sports such as longdistance running have different nutritional
demands compared to strengthbased sports like weightlifting 2. understanding these
differences is crucial for developing effective dietary strategies that support the unique
needs of each athlete.
evaluating the current dietary practices of athletes is a multifaceted endeavor that
extends beyond mere observation of food intake. it involves a deep dive into the intricacies
of athletes nutritional habits encompassing the identification of common deficiencies or
excesses that could impact performance 7. this comprehensive evaluation is crucial as it
lays the groundwork for developing more effective and personalized nutritional strategies.
by understanding the realworld dietary patterns of athletes including their specific nu
tritional gaps and excesses sports nutritionists and dietitians can tailor interventions that
address these unique needs 8. this approach is not only about enhancing performance
but also about ensuring the overall health and wellbeing of the athlete. the complexity of
this task is compounded by the diverse range of sports each with its specific nutritional
demands making the role of individualized dietary assessment and planning even more
critical 9. the factors influencing nutritional choices among athletes are as diverse as
the sports themselves. personal p
