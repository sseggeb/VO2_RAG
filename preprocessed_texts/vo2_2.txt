although large body scientific work reported effect vo2max training relatively articles compared response training matched total metabolic energy total work per session. interval continuous ct training various variants constitute base line training regimes improve physical fitness. vo2 associated submaximal ct reflects mainly atp production aerobic mechanisms. oxidative processes predominate associated lipid utilization little anaerobic glycolysis utilization creatine phosphate depletion. furthermore predominant slow-twitch fiber recruitment type exercise. exercise vo2 represents addition two terms vo2 work vo2 recovery. work periods intensity near 100 higher large o2 deficit manifest. reflected high atp utilization anaerobic mechanisms consequently high muscle atp cp myoglobin depletion high lactate production. partially recovery atp cp myoglobin recovery. lactate removed rest intervals via oxidation glycogen synthesis liver kidney heart skeletal muscles. intensity work load results high rate fast-twitch fiber recruitment. may change motor unit recruitment patterns induce specific biochemical adaptations fast-twitch fibers. general known whether ct
