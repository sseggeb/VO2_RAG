1 introduction 
1.1 overview 
whole body maximal oxygen uptake maximum aerobic power aerobic capacity vo2max 
of human beings has interested researchers for many years and regular reviews have been 
published saltin and strange 1992 nielsen 2003. its absolute magnitude and malleability 
with physical training has practical interest for elite soldiers for the sports elite and for 
anyone involved in physical exercise. important for the interest in the topic is also that 
determination of oxygen uptake not only is a measure of aerobic energy turnover but also 
offers precise measure of the capacity to transport and utilize oxygen i.e. the functional 
capacities of the lungs cardiovascular system and muscle mitochondria combined. in general 
aerobic power has been recognized as one of the fundamental components of physical 
performance and health strand and rodahl 1986 johnson 19911.  
during exercise the increase in metabolism is expressed as the whole-body oxygen uptake 
that increases with exercise intensity to reach a maximum vo2max. in general the oxygen 
consumption vo2 in humans seems to level off at around 6-7 liter oxygen min and around 
80-90 mlminkg for highly trained athletes saltin and strand 1967 rusko et al. 19782. 
different steps in the oxygen o2 chain from air to the cells are considered to contribute as a 
barrier for o2 utilization. the first step of the oxygen o2 transport chain is the conductive 
transport of o2 from the expired air to the alveoli r1. this conductive transport from 
inspired to alveolar gas is next followed by a diffusive flow of o2 from the alveoli to the 
arterial blood r2. the next step is a conductive transport of o2 to the cells where vo2 q 
ca-cv r3. q is the cardiac output and ca and cv is the capillary and venous o2 content 
respectively. we can also write that ca-cv  beta b pa-pv where beta is the mean slope of 
the blood o2 dissociation curve3 b is the solvability of o2 in the blood4. pa is the arterial o2 
pressure while pv is the venous o2 pressure. thus vo2 q beta b pa-pv r3. a next step  
1three major factors accounting for aerobic endurance is simply the vo2max the work economy and the 
capacity to sustain a high fractional utilization of the aerobic power pate and kriska 1984. the role of the 
oxidative capacity of the muscles might be most important during submaximal work of long duration and when 
relatively small muscle mass is activated long distance running or skiing. vo2max might be the most 
important determinant of performance when large muscle mass is activated during maximal work from several 
minutes to 1 h typically cross-country skiing rusko et al. 1978. there is a strong correlation between running 
performance and vo2max when the groups investigated are heterogeneously trained athletes. however in 
populations with more homogeneously trained athletes the correlation with running performance is relatively 
weak. world class cross-country skiers had extremely high vo2max values and vo2max per unit time per unit 
mass raised to the power of 23 seems to be a fairly accurate determinant of the performance ability of elite 
cross-country skiers ingjer 1991. 
2 a linear increase in aerobic power induced by a strenuous program of endurance exercise has been observed 
without any tendency to flatten out mikesell and dudley 1984 hickson et al. 1977. 
3 the blood o2 dissociation curve i.e. the  percentage saturation of o2 as a function of  o2 pressure shifts to the 
right for increasing temperature ph or carbon dioxide content. 
4 in mammalian blood the amount of physically dissolved oxygen is around 0.2 ml o2 per 100 ml blood while 
the amount bound to hemoglobin is around 20 ml o2 pr 100 ml blood. in water the amount physically dissolved 
is around 0.5 ml100 ml water. the venous o2 content is typical around 6 ml o2 per 100 ml blood. this gives an 
extraction of 20-620 70. for elite skiers extraction up to 93 can be achieved calbet et al. 2005. 
comparing vo2max improvement  in five training methods                                              933  
in the o2 chain is the diffusive transport of o2 from the muscle capillary to the mitochondria 
r4. the final step is the utilization of o2 in the mitochondria r5. thus al together it can 
be written that vo2max pi-pmr1r2r3r4r5 where pi is the partial pressure of 
o2 in expired air and pm is the partial pressure of o2 in the mitochondria. during maximal 
exercise with large muscle groups it has been found that r3 is around 50 of 
r1r2r3r4r5. let qmax be the maximal value of the cardiac output q. using the 
numbers above it follows that an increase of qmax x beta by 10 gives an increase in 
vo2max of 5. it has been found that r4 and r5 contribute around 7 each. thus at 
maximal exercise the cardiac output seems to be the major factor in determining the oxygen 
delivery. r1 and r2 sum to 36 wagner 2000 di prampero 2003.  
the amount of trainability of the parameters r1-r5 is important. for soldiers and elite 
athletes or indeed for anyone engaged in athletic activity it is important to know how 
intensity duration frequency of training and the initial fitness level of the individual relate to 
vo2max enhancement through time. when comparing trained and untrained college students 
with olympic athletes the overall dominant difference is the cardiac output q and the 
systemic arteriovenous o2 difference ca-cv. for control students and olympic athletes the 
vo2max is 3.30 and 5.38 liter o2 per minute respectively blomqvist and saltin 1983. this 
is a factor 1.63 in advance of the olympic athletes. the cardiac output q was 20 and 30.4 liter 
blood per minute respectively which gives a factor of 1.52 in advance of the olympic 
athletes. the ca-cv 74 and 80 respectively giving a factor of 8074 1.08 in advance 
for the olympic athletes. a total factor of 1.52 x 1.081.64 is achieved. this leaves little 
room for trainability of r1r2r4r5 which indeed is roughly the same factor 
1.631.641.0. however the maximum stroke volume5 of the heart was 104 ml for the 
students and 167 ml for the olympic athletes. this gives a factor of 1.6 in advance of the 
olympic athletes. the olympic athletes have a somewhat smaller maximum heart rate of 182 
compared to 192 for the students 192182 11.52 x 1.6. the volume of oxygen consumed 
during physical exercise is dependent upon the load on the muscles and also on the mass of 
muscles at work. if maximum heart rate is achieved the engaged muscle mass is usually 
sufficient. however even for maximum heart rate the vo2max often differs across activities. 
usually ca-cv could be much smaller for instance in swimming that in running leaving much 
room for improvement strand and saltin 1961. a change in the ca-cv difference could be 
due to either a redistribution of blood flow andor increased o2 extraction from the blood by 
skeletal muscle as such6. 
the early studies did not address the cardiac output q and the arteriovenous o2 difference 
ca-cv separately for the vo2max enhancement. however many years ago it was suggested 
that longer duration and higher intensity may be require to increase ca-cv compared to the 
cardiac output q kilbom 1971. this hypothesis was supported by cunningham and hill 
1975 showing that a period of 9 weeks training resulted in significant increase in vo2max  
5 the volume of blood pumped per beat. 
6 a relationship has been observed between vo2max and muscle fiber types indicating that a subject with a high 
vo2max will most probably have a high percentage of slow twitch fibers in the exercising muscles bergh et al. 
1978 rusko et al. 1978. see also calbet et al. 2004 for extraction studies on skiers. 
934                                                                                               j. f. moxnes and k. hausken 
which was due to a larger stroke volume with little change in ca-cv. however when training 
for 1 year a significant increase in ca-cv was found. so indeed the cardiac output q and the 
arteriovenous o2 difference ca-cv are the two key parameters for trainability of vo2max. 
for a specific oxygen uptake say 3 liter per minute below vo2max training increases the 
arteriovenous o2 difference ca-cv and reduces the cardiac output q ekblom et al. 1968. 
however cunningham and hill 1975 found that training increases the cardiac output for the 
same vo2. gledhill et al. 1994 found that trained persons had a cardiac output of q 7.2 
5.9 x vo2 litermin while untrained persons had q 6.6 5.1 vo2 liter min. the heart 
rate at the same oxygen uptake is reduced by training while the stroke volume is much the 
same ekblom et al. 1968 or higher cunningham and hill1975. the stroke volume seems 
to be increasing with vo2 cunningham and hill1975 gledhill et al. 1994 warburton and 
gledhill 2008. however for untrained persons the stroke volume seems to plateau at a heart 
rate of around 120 beats per minute. it is hypothesized that at high heart rates the progressive 
diminishing time available for diastolic filling limits stroke volume causing a plateau. 
however for trained athletes because of an enhanced myocardial contractility less time in 
cardiac cycle would be required for ventricular emptying so that more time would be 
available for blood filling gledhill et al. 19947. 
from an evolutionary perspective it would be relevant to study the effect of different training 
programs when matched for total metabolic energy consumption per training session8. 
although a large body of scientific work has been reported on the effect of vo2max on 
training relatively few articles have compared the response of training when matched for total 
metabolic energy or total work per session. interval it and continuous ct training of 
various variants constitute a base of line of training regimes to improve physical fitness. the 
vo2 associated with submaximal ct reflects mainly atp production from aerobic 
mechanisms. oxidative processes predominate and are associated with lipid utilization little 
anaerobic glycolysis utilization or creatine phosphate depletion. furthermore there is 
predominant slow-twitch fiber recruitment with this type of exercise. with it exercise vo2 
represents the addition of two terms vo2 during work and vo2 during recovery. for the 
work periods the intensity is near 100 or higher and a large o2 deficit is manifest. this is 
reflected by a high atp utilization from anaerobic mechanisms and consequently a high 
muscle atp cp and myoglobin depletion and high lactate production. there is a partially 
recovery of atp cp and myoglobin during recovery. lactate is removed during the rest 
intervals via oxidation and glycogen synthesis in liver kidney heart and skeletal muscles. the 
intensity work load in it results in a high rate of fast-twitch fiber recruitment. it may change 
motor unit recruitment patterns and induce specific biochemical adaptations in fast-twitch 
fibers. in general it is not known whether it or ct stimulates cardiac output and systemic 
arteriovenous o2 difference differently. presumably a good measure for increased cardiac 
output is increased stroke volume which should correlate with decreased resting heart rate. a 
good measure for systemic arteriovenous o2 increase could be enhancement in the vo2 per  
7 the stroke volume and its function of the utilization of vo2max or maximum heart rate is under intense 
discussion. see also vella and roberts 2004. 
8 we set that match by total work or match by total energy expenditure to be much the same.

unit cardiac output. one would hypothesize that it with oscillations in vo2 throughout the 
exercise and pause periods might better enhance the o2 kinetic response. 
roskam 1967 studied the effect of ct and it training matched by total work. soldiers 
cycled 5 times a week for 4 weeks for. the ct group was most effective in decreasing the 
heart rate at rest and in the low and middle intensity. however the it group was more 
effective in improving the maximum work performance. knuttgen et al. 1973 studied three 
groups running 3 times per week for 8 weeks. the groups were somewhat matched for work 
performance. one group performed strenuous exercise for 15 seconds and 15 seconds rest. a 
second group performed 3 minute strenuous exercise and 3 minutes rest. the first group 
increased the vo2max by a factor of 1.16 while the second group increased the vo2max by 
a factor 1.26 after 8 weeks. fox et al. 1973 studied two groups that run for 7 weeks 3 times a 
week. the groups were matched for work. the first group runs 50-200 meter fast pace sprint 
while the second group runs 600-1200 meters at relatively slow pace running. the vo2max 
increased by a factor of 1.09 for the first group and a factor of 1.05 for the second group. it 
was concluded that muscular hypoxia per se is an important stimulus for the improvement of 
maximal aerobic power. fox et al. 1977 studied two groups that ran 3 times a week for 8 
weeks. the workouts for the high power group consisted of a maximum of 19 high intensity 
runs at 30 seconds duration alternated with relief or recovery intervals long enough in 
duration to allow the heart rate to return between 120 and 140 beatsmin. the workout for the 
low intensity group consisted of a maximum of 7 lower intensity runs of 2-min duration with 
rest relief intervals lasting until the heart rates returned to between 120 and 140 beats min. 
the groups were matched for work. it was found that low power and high power output 
interval training programs elicit similar changes in maximal aerobic and anaerobic 
metabolism. eddy et al. 1977 studied subjects participating in a training program upon 
bicycle ergometer for 7 weeks with training 4 days a week. the ct group trained at 70 
vo2max and the it group trained at 100 vo2max for 1 minute and 1 minute rest. ct and 
it training produced identical changes in heart rate response blood lactic acid concentration 
and vo2max when the total work load was equated per training session. the ct group and 
the it increased the vo2max with a factor 1.15 and 1.14 respectively. lesmes et al. 1978 
studied groups that run it with different intensity 4 times a week for 8 weeks. one group runs 
short distances at 50- 200 meters with an intensity of around 170 vo2max. the other group 
runs distances of 600-1200 meters at intensity of 170. the high intensity group increased 
the vo2max by a factor of 1.15 while the low intensity group increased the vo2max by a 
factor of 1.20. gregory 1979 studied two groups that run 5 times a week for 6 weeks. the 
training was matched for total work performance. the ct group runs at the heart rate of 162 
while the it group runs 4 minutes and rests 4 minutes with heart rate 174. the ct group 
increased the vo2 at a given pulse by a factor of 1.20 while the it group increased the vo2 
with a factor 1.24. cunningham et al. 1979 designed a study on cycling to determine the 
effect of ct and it programs on the cardiac q and the peripheral ca-cv response to 
training. the total work was matched between the groups. cunningham et al. 1979 studied 
two groups. the ct group cycled for an intensity of 70 of vo2max for 20 minutes 4 times 
per week for 12 weeks. the it group cycled with an intensity of 90-100 of vo2max for 2 
minutes with a 1 minute rest period. both groups demonstrated similar and significant 
increase in ca-cv leading to an vo2max enhancement of around 20 but only a marginal  
936                                                                                               j. f. moxnes and k. hausken 
stroke volume enhancement. it was suggested that the cycling utilized a too small muscle 
mass compared to jogging and may therefore place a lesser demand on the heart as a pump to 
emphasize extraction of oxygen by the working muscles. fourier et al. 1982 compared 
skeletal muscle adaption in sprint and endurance training. it was found that ci increased 
vo2max glygolytic phosphofructokinase pfk oxidative succinate dehydrogenase sdh 
st and ft muscle fiber area. sprint training only results in significant enhanced pfk. 
thomas et al. 1984 found that interval training may benefit aerobic capacity more than 
continuos running in young adults who have moderately high initial fitness level. they in 
particular studied continuous 4 miles running at 75 of maximum heart rate and 8 sets of 1 
minute running and 3 minutes walking with 90 of maximum heart rate in the running 
period. the energy consumption was around 500 kcal per session. the enhancement in 
vo2max after three sessions per week in 12 weeks was 6.9 for continuous running and 
10.3 for the interval training. poole and gaesser 1985 found that for the group training 
continuously for 55 minutes at 50 of vo2max 3 days a week the vo2max increased by 
15 after 8 weeks. the group training continuously for 35 minutes at 75 increased the 
vo2max by 20. the group training interval 2 minutes at 105 vo2max with 2 minutes 
rest walking10 repetitions increased the vo2max by 15 mxxhave number for 4 weeks 
also 1.17 1.12 1.16. the groups were matched for work performance. gorostiaga et al. 
1991 studied two groups. one group cycled continuously for 50 of vo2max 20 minutes 3 
days a week for 8 weeks. the group that trained interval trained 30 seconds at 100 
vo2max and 30 seconds rest for 20 minutes. the increase in vo2max was 7 and 11 
respectively. overend et al. 1992 investigated the change in vo2max during 10 weeks 4 
times a week of training on cycle ergometer. the group performing continuous cycling for 40 
minutes at 80 of vo2max increased the vo2max by 8. the group performing interval 
training in 3 minutes at 100 vo2max and 2 minutes at 50 vo2 max increased the 
vo2max by 9. the other group performing interval training for 30 seconds at 120 
vo2max and 30 seconds at 40 vo2max increased the vo2max by 17. all the groups 
were matched for work. edge et al. 2005 compared ci and it training. the ci performed 
20-30 minutes at vo2max of 80-05. the it performed sprints at 120-140 vo2max for 2 
minutes. the groups trained 3 times a week for 5 weeks. the vo2max increased with around 
11 for the it group and around 9 for the ci group. 
all together the results in the literature are somewhat conflicting with regards to the effect of 
it or ct training on vo2max. intensity and quantity of work performed during the training 
program appeared to be more important than any differences in trainingtype protocol. 
vo2max increases with intensity when holding work constant burke and franks 1975 and 
with time holding intensity constant milesis et al. 1976. for a review see wenger and bell 
1986. it becomes appropriate to quantify training load tl for work and intensity. to 
quantify tl for work and intensity different methods have been used. for endurance the 
concepts for quantifying the training load has been the training impulse trimp banister et 
al. 1975 banister et al. 1984 morton et al. 1990 taha and thomas 2003. trimp is the 
cumulated exercise duration multiplied with a weight function that depends on the heart rate 
vo2 or the lactate level see section 3 for further discussion. the model has been used in 
running morton et al. 1990 cycling busso et al. 1991 busso et al. 1997 swimming 
banister et al. 1975 weight lifting busso et al. 1994 and triathlon millet et al. 2002.

1.2 this papers contribution 
this paper uses a fitness function that synthesizes all positive effects causing increased 
performance and a fatigue function that synthesizes all negative effects causing fatigue 
moxnes and hausken 2008. banister et al. 1975 define performance as fitness minus 
fatigue whereas this paper defines performance as fitness multiplied with an exponential 
decay function that accounts for fatigue. during exercise fatigue increases more than fitness 
and performance decrease. after exercise during the recovery fatigue decreases faster than 
fitness and performance increase and reaches a higher level than before exercise. if a new 
exercise occurs before complete recovery from the preceding one the negative effect due to 
fatigue would be amplified and the recovery time needed would be longer than if there was a 
longer gap between exercise sessions. this paper considers exercise induced muscle damage 
as one possible realistic variable descriptive of fatigue. analogously we consider muscle 
fitness to account for fitness. but this includes the heart muscle which provides a link so that 
the paper models maximum stroke volume of the heart as performance. we compare 
helgerud et al.s 2007 experimental study of four training methods together with a fifth 
training method presented in this paper against moxnes and hauskens 2008 theoretical 
model for athletic performance fitness and fatigue. an athletes training impulse trimp is 
developed and used in the analysis. the trimp intensity which is defined as the trimp per 
unit time equals the aerobic utilization multiplied with a weight function which scales the 
importance of stroke volume utilization. the analysis implies developing a weight function 
for stroke volume enhancement which is compared with banister et al.s 19851986 
exponential weight function. 
section 2 presents helgerud et al.s 2007 four training methods and a fifth training method. 
section 3 determines energy consumption and training impulse. section 4 conducts an 
empirical study of helgerud et al.s 2007 four training methods using heart rate monitors. 
section 5 develops a mathematical model of performance maximum stroke volume. section 
6 simulates the model. section 7 simulates alternative training methods. section 8 concludes. 
2 the five training methods 
helgerud et al. 2007 analyzed the effect of four different training methods on vo2max and 
stroke volume. the four groups ran three sessions per week for eight weeks on a treadmill 
with 5.3 upward incline. each session started with 10 min warmup at 60 of vo2max and 
ended with three minutes of cooldown. each session comprised warmup exercise and 
cooldown. 
a long slow distance running lsd at 60 of vo2max for 45 min. hence warmup and 
cooldown have the same vo2max percentage as the exercise. b lactate threshold running 
lt at 80 of vo2max for 24.25 min. c 1515 interval training 1515 at 87.5 of 
vo2max 47 times each period lasting 15 sec. exercise proceeded at 60 of vo2max during 
the 46 rest periods each lasting 15 sec. d 4x4 min interval training 4x4 at 87.5 of  
938                                                                                               j. f. moxnes and k. hausken 
vo2max four times each period lasting 4 min. exercise proceeded at 60 of vo2max 
during the rest periods each lasting three min.9 
55 non-smoking and well trained male university students took part in the study. their mean 
weight was 82 kg with vo2max 54 mlminkg before the study. this gives a maximum 
aerobic power 
m
e 1500w10. before the study the participants trained 3 times per week. the 
exercise regime for the groups was matched such that their total energy consumption 
including warmup exercise rest periods and cooldown was equivalent in all sessions. this 
gives 5.9 km running distance per session around for around 130 l oxygen. this gives around 
130 x 1000 202.6 106 j622 kcal. 
helgerud et al. 2007 found that the stroke volume decreased with 1 for lsd increased 
with a factor 1.0093 for lt increased with a factor of 1.094 for 1515 and increased with a 
factor 1.104 for 4x4 table 2 in helgerud et al. 2007. they found that vo2max decreased 
with 0.6 for lsd and increased with 2.0 for lt 5.5 for 1515 and 7.2 for 4x4 table 
1 in helgerud et al. 2007. all groups had improvement in the running economy mlmeter 
kg0.75 that is 8 for lsd 12 for lt 8 for 1515 and 10 for 4x4. somewhat 
surprisingly no changes were found in the lactate threshold for any of the groups.  
this implies that 4x4 and 1515 increase vo2max but not that 4x4 and 1515 are optimal 
training method in the sense maximum improvement in vo2max per session for a given 
energy consumption per session.

multiplication with 60 is to convert to time in seconds. equation 3.2 also determines values 
for a fifth hypothetical training method subscript lqd referred to as long quick distance 
running where the participant runs at the same vo2max percentage as under 1515 and 44 
that is 87.5 of vo2max but without rest periods. there is a warm up of 10 minutes and a 
cool down of 3 minutes. such a training method is common for ambitious participants and is 
easily performed by athletes during competition. the runner runs for 22.17 min chosen such 
that the runner consumes the same energy as under 4x4. equation 3.2 implies
