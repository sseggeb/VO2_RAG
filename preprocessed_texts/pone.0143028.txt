purpose
the purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of moderatehigh altitude on power out
put cadence speed and heart rate during a multiday cycling tour.
methods
power output heart rate speed and cadence were collected from elite male road cyclists
during maximal efforts of 5 15 30 60 240 and 600 s. the efforts were completed in a labo
ratory powerprofile assessment and spontaneously during a cycling race simulation near
sealevel and an international cycling race at moderatehigh altitude. matched data from the
laboratory powerprofile and the highest maximal mean power output mmp and corre
sponding speed and heart rate recorded during the cycling race simulation and cycling race
at moderatehigh altitude were compared using paired ttests. additionally all mmp and
corresponding speeds and heart rates were binned per 1000m 1000m 10002000
20003000 and 3000m according to the average altitude of each ride. mixed linear
modelling was used to compare cycling performance data from each altitude bin.
results
power output was similar between the laboratory powerprofile and the race simulation
however mmps for 5600 s and 15 60 240 and 600 s were lower p  0.005 during the
race at altitude compared with the laboratory powerprofile and race simulation respec
tively. furthermore peak power output and all mmps were lower  11.7 p  0.001
while racing 3000 m compared with rides completed near sealevel. however speed asso
ciated with mmp 60 and 240 s was greater p  0.001 during racing at moderatehigh alti
tude compared with the race simulation near sealevel.

conclusion
a reduction in oxygen availability as altitude increases leads to attenuation of cycling power
output during competition. decrement in cycling power output at altitude does not seem to
affect speed which tended to be greater at higher altitudes.
introduction
early research has described the performance characteristics of historic competitive cycling
events that predominantly take place at low altitudes  1000 m. ebert et al. 1 determined
that cyclists spend most time 80 at low to moderate power outputs 24.9 w.kg1 and
least time at highest power outputs 8 w.kg1 during flat hilly and criterium races. further
more ebert et al. 1 reported that for all race types there are numerous 2070 short dura
tion bursts 330 s at power greater than the power output associated with maximal oxygen
uptake. others have described cycling events by reporting the typical heart rate response to
cycling competition. although the heart rate response may vary depending on the type and ter
rain of an event mean heart rates for competitive road cycling races are 135 beats per minute
bpm with higher values 140 bpm for time trials or hilly events 25. cycling cadence
and speed like heart rate are largely affected by the type and terrain of a race. generally slow
est speeds and cadences are reported during hilly events while fastest speeds and cadences are
reported during flat races and time trials 13.
in recent years road cycling events sanctioned by the union cycliste internationale uci
have spread globally and are more frequently occurring either partly or entirely in moderate
high altitude 20005000 m environments e.g. tour of qinghai lake tour of utah stages of
grand tours. as most famously observed at the 1968 olympic games in mexico city compe
tition at altitude has consequences for both speed and endurance with lower air density having
a positive impact on speed over short distances whilst endurance performance is impaired 6.
the change to inspired partial pressure of oxygen at higher altitudes presents a number of chal
lenges to underlying physiological processes that determine or regulate cycling performance.
laboratory based investigations have reported that cycling power output for short to long
intervals is attenuated during acute exposure to normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions
79. reductions in power output during laboratory cycling are likely the result of a decrease
in the oxygenation of muscular and cerebral tissue leading to perturbations to working muscle
metabolism central neural drive and pacing regulation 710. such changes are likely to be
reflected by changes in the performance characteristics of real world cycling competitions
occurring in similar conditions. others have reported changes in activity distribution and per
formance indices during team sports at moderatehigh altitude 1113. alternatively it is pos
sible the reduced air density at altitude results in faster cycling speeds for the same power
output resulting in faster cycling races than at sea level 1416. however to our knowledge
no articles exist describing the effects of moderatehigh altitude on the performance of cyclists
during competitive road events.
therefore while the performance characteristics of cycling competitions that take place at
relatively low altitudes 1000 m have been well described the effects of moderatehigh alti
tude on competitive cycling performance remain largely unknown. consequently the purpose
of this study was to quantify the acute effects of racing at moderatehigh altitude on power out
put speed and heart rate compared with sea level efforts in a group of nonacclimatized low
altitude natives. we hypothesized that cycle racing at moderatehigh altitude would result in a
power output during racing at altitude

altitude due to the reduction in air density.
methods
study design
ride data of elite male cyclists table 1 were collected during a sevenday cycling race simulation
near sea level n  12 and during a 14day cycling stage race at moderate to high altitude
n  14 17. cyclists who completed the sevenday race simulation also completed a powerpro
file test in controlled laboratory conditions near sea level n  12. the study was approved by
the australian institute of sport human ethics committee and the qinghai institute of sport
science ethics committee. all cyclists provided written informed consent before participating.
powerprofile test
the powerprofile test 18 was completed by all cyclists involved in the simulated tour
n  12. the test was conducted at 600m altitude in controlled laboratory conditions at the
australian institute of sport canberra using a custom built windbraked ergometer fitted with
a dynamically calibrated scientific eight strain gauge srm power meter srm training system
schoberer rad messtecknick germany with power sampled at 5 hz. the individual bicycle
riding position of each rider was replicated on the ergometer along with their respective pedal
system and crank length. following a selfselected warm up 15min at 100200w including
23 rolling sprints the cyclists were asked to produce sequentially six maximal selfpaced
efforts 2 x 5 15 30 60 240 s from a rolling start with active recovery periods of 55 175 225
330 and 480 s respectively. power data were analysed using commercially available software
srm version 6.42.18 after each test. specifically peak power 1 s peak and the maximum
mean power mmp and heart rate hr for 5 15 30 60 and 240 s were identified. in addi
tion the mmp for 600 s was predicted using the critical power feature of the publically avail
able software golden cheetah version 3.0.2. the power profile test has previously been
shown to predict cycling road mmp within race situations 18 and is therefore an ecologically
valid tool to assess cycling specific power producing capabilities.

tour near sea level canberra and surrounds australia one month prior to the race in china.
due to the racing schedules of the riders it was only possible to simulate the first seven stages
of the race s 17. each stage was recreated based on the course description listed on the
race organisers website with the aim being to replicate the stage distance and elevation gain as
closely as possible table 2. the elevation gain was measured with barometric altimeters
srm pc7 schoberer rad messtecknick germany or garmin edge 500 garmin usa which
have been previously shown to provide consistent measures of elevation gain 19. in addition
race scenarios and tactics including sprint primes and breakaways were recreated with the
assistance of coaching staff in an attempt to introduce race intensity to the simulation. due to
injuries sustained in training during the three weeks prior to the tour of qinghai lake two
cyclists were unable to travel to china and were replaced by reserves. thus ten cyclists com
pleted both the simulated tour and the tour of qinghai lake.
tour of qinghai lake
the 2013 tour of qinghai lake was a sanctioned uci 2.hc hors category race and consisted
of 13 stages with one rest day after the first eight stages. the race began in xining in the qing
hai province of china and covered 2002 km before the finish in lanzhou. the average altitude
of the entire race was 2496 m however the first eight stages occurred at highest altitudes
2000 m tourh while the remaining five stages took place at lower altitudes 2000 m
tourl. stages were classified by race organisers as mountainous mtn hilly or flat accord
ing to the elevation profile of each individual stage. each team consisted of seven riders and
included uci pro tour procontinental continental and national teams. five riders from
the two teams participating in the study were withdrawn from the race to due to injury illness
or failure to complete a stage within the allocated finishing time.

ride data
all ride data were collected using dynamically calibrated srm srm training system scho
berer rad messtecknick germany or quarq quarq elsa quarq usa power meters and
data loggers srm pc7 schoberer rad messtecknick germany or garmin edge 500 garmin
usa. each power meter was calibrated using a dynamic calibration rig as described previously
20. the zero offset for each power meter was configured using the automatic function as
per the manufacturers recommendations. power speed cadence distance and heart rate were
collected at 1 hz for the duration of each ride and logged data were downloaded onto a laptop
and analysed using publically available software golden cheetah version 3.0.2.
data analyses
after removing erroneous data files n  13 and accounting for rider withdrawal due to injury
illness or failure to complete a stage within the allocated finishing time n  5 a total of 187
rides were available for analysis. the following variables were calculated for each ride 1 total

statistical analyses
the 187 rides were initially categorised into race simulation 17 s 17 race stages 17 r
17 tour stages 18 tourh and tour stages 913 tourl. ten cyclists completed the lab
oratory powerprofile test s 17 and r 17 table 3 thus their matched data were compared
using paired ttests with bonferroni correction for multiple comparison to determine differ
ences in peak mmp single highest mmp achieved by each rider during any ride within the cat
egory and associated heart rates and speeds s 17 and r 17 only. the same comparisons
were made between tourh and tourl for the nine cyclists who completed the entire race.
to further quantify the effects of altitude on cycling performance the 187 rides were
binned according to their mean altitude and linear mixed models were fitted using the nlme
package for the statistical program r version 3.1.0 r foundation for statistical consulting.
subsequently altitude was considered a factor of four levels near sealevel race simulation
and the reference level for altitude 10002000 m 20003000 m and 3000 m. race character
istics power speed cadence and heart rate all mmp for 1600 s and the proportion of race
time spent in different power output and cadence bands were fitted as response variables with
altitude and cyclist included as the fixed and random effects respectively. to support interpre
tation estimates of the fixed effects obtained from the log scale have been converted to a per
centage change in each respective response variable and displayed with their 95 confidence

race characteristics
table 4 outlines the general characteristics for rides completed during the race simulation and
during the tour of qinghai lake binned according to altitude. mean power for rides completed
during s 17 ranged from 186 to 213 w while mean power during r 17 ranged from 147 to
194 w. mean heart rate ranged from 123 to 139 bpm during s 17 and was similar r 17
121142 bpm while mean cadence ranged from 78 to 91 rpm during s 17 and like heart
rate was similar during r 17 8089 rpm. conversely mean speed tended to be lower during
the s 17 29.328.7 km.h1 compared with r 17 28.844.1 km.h1.
power output
there were no significant differences between mmp measured during the laboratory power
profile test and peak mmp measured during s 17 fig 1. however mmp 5600 s were signif

15 60 240 and 600 s were significantly lower p  0.004 during r 17 compared with the s
17. generally mmps were similar for tourh compared with tourl however mmp 30 and
240 s were significantly higher during tourl when compared to tourh.
when comparing rides completed in different altitude bins mmp for 1 and 5 s were similar
for races completed below 3000 m altitude fig 2. however during rides above 3000 m mmp

discussion
to our knowledge this is the first study describing the effects of moderatehigh altitude on per
formance during an international multiday road cycling competition. the main finding of the
present study was a significant reduction in the maximal mean power outputs of sealevel
natives during cycling stage racing at moderatehigh altitudes compared with laboratory
cycling assessment and a race simulation near sealevel. additionally power output heart rate
and cadence data indicate that the simulated race situations provided a valid representation of
the cycling competition.
validity of the race simulation
in lieu of a suitably comparable cycling event near sea level a race simulation was used to
examine the performance of sealevel natives during low altitude cycle racing. a somewhat
crude comparison of mean power output speed heart rate and the relative time spent within
different power zones observed during the race simulation and reported by other investigations
of road cycling competitions 15 indicates that the race simulation was largely effective in
mimicking the physiological demands of real competition. however more sophisticated evalu
ation of mmp recorded for discrete time periods further indicates the simulation was a valid
example of sealevel racing. specifically there were no differences between power measured
during a laboratory powerprofile test which is highly predictive of sealevel performance
capability 18 and peak mmps recorded across the race simulation. additionally the heart

rates associated with simulation mmp and laboratory powerprofile were similar with the
exception of 240 s which was higher during the laboratory test. therefore given the broad sim
ilarities between the race simulation laboratory powerprofile and race profiles from earlier
investigations the race simulation appears to provide a valid representation of the physiologi
cal and performance characteristics of cycling competition near sea level and hence provides a
reference point for comparison to competition at altitude in the present study.
effect of altitude on cycle racing power output
exercise capacity was perturbed during moderatehigh altitude cycling stage racing manifest
ing as a reduction in peak mmp for 5600 s and 15 60 240 and 600 s when compared to labo
ratory powerprofile assessment and the race simulation near sealevel respectively. the
reduction in longer duration mmp  240 s observed in the current study is likely the result
of impairment of the aerobic energy system at higher altitudes. an increase in altitude is associ
ated with a reduction in arterial oxygen availability and oxygen delivery during exercise 21
23 which leads to a linear reduction in maximal oxygen uptake as altitude increases particu
larly in highly trained endurance athletes 21 24 25. indeed further analysis using all mmps
i.e. not just the peak recorded throughout the race simulation and tour of qinghai lake
revealed a decline in mmp for 240 and 600 s of 6 per 1000 m above sealevel confirming
the results of earlier laboratory analyses 8 21 25. however as one of a multitude of factors
that determine performance 26 it is unlikely a decline in oxygen uptake explains all changes
observed in the present study. alterations in the ventilatory response to exercise including an
increase in ventilation 21 and the ventilatory equivalents for o2 and co2 22 have also been
reported in hypoxia. additionally valli et al. 27 suggested the hyperventilatory response to
hypoxia could create a diversion of blood flow to the inspiratory muscles. the overall sum of
the ventilatory response to hypoxia is therefore likely to increase the energy and o2 cost of
inspiration and inhibit exercise performance at high altitude.
an interesting and novel finding of the present study was a decline in short duration and
high intensity cycling mmp 60 s for which the contribution of oxidative energetic pathways
is low 28. in contrast previous investigations reported no decline in sprint cycling perfor
mance in hypoxia when performed as an isolated 30 s effort 29 or as the first in a sequence of
10 s efforts 30. however the mmps recorded in the current study did not occur in isolation
but more likely after earlier epochs of variable intensity cycling as necessitated by tactics and
the actions of other racers. in this regard smith and billaut 30 indicated a greater amount
work was completed in normoxia compared with hypoxia when sprints were repeated multiple
times and therefore with an existing load from previous efforts. interestingly smith and billaut
30 pointed to a marked increase in cerebral deoxygenation as being the predominant cause of
reduced sprint performance in hypoxia. further research indicates central neural drive is
inhibited during intense exercise in hypoxia as a result of cerebral deoxygenation 9 10 31 a
reduction in cerebral blood flow 9 and faster rates of peripheral muscle fatigue 7. it is likely
the sprint performances of riders in the current study were limited by similar perturbations in
central neural drive reflecting a reduction in global exercise capacity and not just exercise per
formance that has a high aerobic energetic contribution.
reductions in mmps were reflected by a change in the overall activity profile of cycle racing
at higher altitudes. like previous investigations of team sports 11 12 we observed a decrease
in the proportion of time spent at higher exercise intensities. additionally there was a concom
itant increase in the time spent at lower exercise intensities and mean power output was 12
lower during races completed above altitudes of 2000 m. similar to previous investigations

with team sport athletes the capacity for high intensity efforts was not preserved even with the
shift to lower overall exercise intensity.
effect of altitude on heart rate speed and cadence
cycling at higher altitude presents an interesting paradox of increased speed despite inhibition
of underlying physiological processes and exercise capacity. various models indicate the opti
mal altitude for short to medium duration 5 s1 hr cycling performance is 25004000 m 6
16 32 33 and as a result many cyclists select moderatehigh altitude locations for world record
attempts. in the current study although power output decreased at higher altitudes there was
no negative effect on speed and in most instances speed was higher during the tour of qinghai
lake compared with the race simulation near sea level. however it is possible the higher speeds
recorded during racing were due to the larger size of the cycling peloton in contrast to our
race simulation which offers aerodynamic advantages 34 additional to reduced air density at
higher altitudes as well as the circuit nature of some of the stages 1.
given previous investigations have reported higher heart rates during submaximal exercise
in hypoxia 8 21 it could be expected to observe higher mean heart rates during racing at
moderatehigh altitude. as mean heart rate was similar between rides within each altitude bin
it could therefore be suggested that hypoxia has little effect on heart rates during submaximal
exercise. however as mean power was lower for rides completed above 2000 m it would
appear that submaximal heart rate was higher in response to hypoxia during cycling racing. in
contrast peak heart rate tended to be lower particularly during racing above 3000 m altitude.
previous research has also reported a reduction in peak heart rate as altitude increases 23 27
and the difference in peak heart rate between sealevel and 3000 m of 6 bpm supports the ear
lier finding of wehrlin and hallen 21 of a decrease in peak heart rate of 2 bpm per 1000 m.
mean cadence tended to be lower for rides completed either near sealevel or 3000 m.
however this is more likely an artefact of the hillier nature of rides completed at these altitudes
during which elevation gain was highest as opposed to an effect of altitude. similar to previous
investigations cyclists spent the greatest proportion of all races at 80100 rpm 1. therefore it
would seem that altitude in this instance has little effect on cycling cadence and cyclists likely
adjust gear ratios to match the lower power outputs.
limitations
given the applied nature of the research the findings outlined above must be treated relative to
some limitations. although careful consideration was given to the design of the race simula
tion it was not possible to control for all race scenarios the size of the respective groups and
the actions of competitors during the tour of qinghai lake. furthermore given the time
demands of participants it was not possible to simulate all stages at sealevel prior to competi
tion. nevertheless this study provides important empirical evidence of the changes in cycling
racing performance in moderate to high altitude environments.
practical implications
the changes in mmp mean power and the global activity profile described above indicate an
overall decline in exercise performance capacity as altitude increases. such a decline has impor
tant implications for athlete load management particularly given the growing trend towards
modelling the response to the training or competition stimuli. therefore it would seem prudent
that scientists coaches and athletes make changes to the parameters of respective models to
reflect an overall decline in performance capacity of 6 per 1000m above sealevel. competi
tion organisers could also consider the decline in performance when planning events at high
power output during racing at altitude

altitudes which are likely to elevate physiological load and adversely affect the welfare of
competitors.
conclusion
maximal mean power outputs for 1600 s were attenuated during cycle racing at moderate and
high altitudes compared with a laboratory power assessment and low altitude racing or race
simulation. reductions in mmps are likely the result of reduced fio2 associated with high alti
tude environments and the subsequent decline in oxygen availability at the musculature of the
lower limb. however it is possible short term mmp 130 s is moderated by lower central
neural drive as it is unlikely limitations in oxygen availability would limit short duration power
output. finally with consideration for course design specific race scenarios and sufficient
group sizes it is possible to simulate a cycling road race with similar power output heart rate
and cadence demands as real race events. such simulations could serve as a valuable tool in
future investigations of performance altering interventions or to further examine the physio
logical response to cycling competition.
