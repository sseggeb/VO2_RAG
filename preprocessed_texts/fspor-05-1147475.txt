introduction this study explored contextual factors which inuence coach
learning of an international cohort of endurance sports coaches.
methods following ethical approval 839 coaches 612 coached athletes and
8352 noncoached athletes participated in the research. a critical realist
research philosophy was adopted in which selfcompletion surveys were
developed in consultation with coaches and industry endusers.
results and discussion the context was dominated by remote coaching practices
and digital technology which shaped how coaches learn and thus what it meant to
be a coach. unmediated learning sources were biophysically biased and largely
delivered through marketised platforms designed to sell products. the study
ndings have broader implications within sport and education in which it is
suggested that remote coaching and learning platforms may sometimes create a
sense of psychoemotional detachment in which capacity for learning can be limited.

1. introduction
what coaches do in their coaching process and who they do it with is fundamental to
how and what they learn 1. the constructivist model of hattie and donoghue 2 is
important in this regard in which they suggest the skill will and thrill of the learner
shapes their development. in a coaching context learning skills orientations towards
learning and motivations shape how coaches learn. the historical and cultural context in
which they operate will inuence what coaches want to learn about 3 4. whilst there is
evidence of a recent shift towards learnercentred processes 5 mediated learning
programmes e.g. coaching courses and clinics and research often fails to recognise the
learning demands of coaches 3 6 7 by failing to consider context 8. in endurance
sport coaches often use remote and digital coaching practices and their unmediated
learning practices. this is because endurance athletes often training independently
without the need for specic facilities and in places where coaches cannot readily observe
performance. however this coaching context or its inuence on how coaches learn has
not been investigated.
this research adds to knowledge by exploring the role and learning of endurance coaches
internationally and how sports specic contextual factors such as technology and market
forces inuence their practice. it is not the aim of the study to redene provide a new
model of coach learning or the coaching process. this is done so in the belief that sports
coaching is not reducible to simple description or explanation 7. rather it is to present
a critical realist cr and subjective perspective of how context shapes the learning of
endurance coaches in an unmediated digital world dominated by the internet and
technology.

2. original research
2.1. coach learning
whilst there are comprehensive texts such as nelson groom and
potrac 9 and a growing body of literature which surrounds coach
learning few authors dene what learning is or explore contextual
factors that affect learning processes. however we suggest that
coach learning is a socially constructed phenomenon inuenced by
historical economic political and cultural forces 10 11.
this suggestion is inuenced by the work of moon 12 13 and
werthner and trudel 14 who were instrumental in developing an
understanding of how coaches learn whether through mediated
unmediated or internal events. moons generic view of learning
has been used extensively to conceptualise coach learning e.g.
1521. this nonreductionist model has been built on the
premise that every concept relates to and modies every other
concept. therefore learning is complex and an allencompassing
theory of what is best does not exist. moons generic view of
learning goes far beyond the simple conceptualisation and
application
of
mediated
unmediated
or
internal
learning
opportunities.
firstly moon recognises that her work primarily focusses on
formal
learning
situations.
however
most
coach
learning
is
simply a product of normal human behaviour and social interaction
1214 22. it tends to occur through trialanderror through
experiences as an athlete by watching other coaches and through
selfdirected learning such as using the internet 14 17 23. thus
coach learning can be viewed as the creation of knowledge through
social participation in daytoday practices 24 primarily in non
formal situated and often unstructured events.
secondly moon 13 highlights the importance of the
emotional component of learning and how it is neglected by
educational research and models of learning. she argues that for
learning to occur learners must rstly be willing to learn and
then develop the ability to contextualise and apply information
within the appropriate environment. emotional engagement is
important if deeper learning is to occur. coaches are typically
adult learners who may only occasionally engage with tertiary
education. when they do they bring with them different
learning dispositions 25 levels of experience and emotional
baggage.
as
hattie
and
donoghue
2
state
the
most
important single factor inuencing learning is what the learner
already knows 2. this knowledge affects not only their agency
to learn but also the consent they give to those who are charged
with educating them 26. thus a onesize ts all approach to
coach learning which does not consider emotional engagement
is unlikely to be efcacious 27.
finally moon 13 recognises that learning does not only occur
in one direction. rather it can result in undesirable changes in
behaviour
or
attitudes
through
assimilating
with
their
environment learning about outdated or ineffective practices
passively soaking up information from questionable sources or
coaching without adequate reection 28. thus some mediated
learning
situations
can
potentially
result
in
learning
that
negatively inuences coaching practice.
thus for learning to occur something must change in the way
that coaches currently think andor act 13 and it is desirable for
coaching practice to change for the better 29. learning is an
active process of knowledge construction rather than passive
information
consumption.
coach
learning
and
practice
are
synergistic
through
the
construction
of
interwoven
beliefs
structures practices and ideologies 10. arguably this results in
complex discourses which are specic to the environment in
which the coach operates. however this sociocultural osmosis
may mean that many coaches simply learn to maintain the
statusquo of their coaching environment and ascribe to its
pervading discourse 30 without deep reection on their practices.
mediated coach education whist viewed as an important in
raising the standards of coaching practice 9 can be relatively
ineffective in facilitating learning e.g. 9 3135. the reasons
for this are complex and multifaceted however a narrow
disciplinary focus 15 35 36 on what is important to learn
about decided on by experts who may not wholly appreciate
the learning context may be a contributory factor. furthermore
coaches must also have sufcient agency to engage with learning
1 and consent to the power being wielded over them 37 by
coach educators. linked to this is socially mediated power
relationships between coaches and coach educators in which there
can be resistance to change or intellectual reasoning 28 38 from
both sides. the fact that learning culture and context are
inherently relational 38 39 41 means that the agency of the
learner must be considered when considering coach learning.
planting
the
seeds
of
intellectual
and
practical
coaching
competencies 42 requires recognition that at one extreme of the
scale formal systematised coach education programmes have a
tendency towards quasicolonial quantication and control. this
may
deskill
coaches
43
through
promoting
information
consumption rather than knowledge construction 26. at the
other extreme the modus operandi of coaches may be the
valorisation of wisdom of the other coaches and populist coaching
information 44 without cognitive reasoning. the pragmatic
middleway is to recognise that coaches will do most of their
learning in unmediated situations and internally.
coach education moves slowly in which frameworks are
usually designed through positivistic and reductionist lens 8
and have typically result in onesize ts all curricula 6 30
45. the international mediated coach education landscape in
endurance sport is diffuse and poorly dened. whilst not
reported in the literature centrally funded national governing
bodies ngb such as british triathlon and british cycling
whose coach education programmes were aligned to the ukcc
framework have in part been adopted by the world governing
bodies the union cycliste internationale and world triathlon.
these programmes have been used to support nations without
their own programmes. throughout the world most coach
education programmes in endurance sport have been built on
more
traditional
conceptualisations
of
facetoface coaching
rather than reecting needs within specic coaching contexts.
one of the motivations for conducting the present study was a
belief that these curricula often bear little resemblance to the
coaching context they fail to consider what motivates coaches to
kirkland and cowley
10.3389fspor.2023.1147475
frontiers in sports and active living
frontiersin.org
learn and what they need to learn about to develop context specic
competence. lyle 46 highlights that this needs led approach can
lead to the desire to conduct research based on a personal desire
to improve practice. adding to the provision of coach education
by ngbs trainingpeaks a commercial business is the global
leader in the provision of a digital platform to support endurance
coaches. their strategy has been typically to partner with larger
ngbs internationally to encourage coaches to use their platform
and these ngbs outsource technology related education to
trainingpeaks.
they
deliver
trainingpeaks
university
workshops and online courses specically focused on how to use
their coaching web technology which is mainly reliant on the
uploading of biophysical data but also supports the development
of coachathlete feedback loops.
thus coachathlete interactions political inuences governing
bodies and market forces all shape learning processes 15 47. in
the digital age different technologies have been incorporated into
coaching and have shaped coaching practice and opened new
affordances
for
athletes
seeking
guidance
particularly
in
endurance sport. the skill will and thill learning model of
hattie and donoghue 2 is important in this regard. as adult
learners coaches will have domain specic beliefs 49 which
inuence how they interpret learning material in relation to
context and relative to previous understandings shaped by
pervading discourses in their sport 13.
therefore we suggest that it is vital to understand what coaches
nd interesting and inuential on their learning. we also suggest
that because the endurance coaching context has not previously
been described there is a limited evidencebase to support
arguments
for
change
at
systemic
level.
however
coach
education has tended to focus on a top down approach
providing coaching pathways which align to linear longterm
athlete development models ltad vested ngb interests and a
drive towards elite performance. this is done without necessarily
considering the learning wants and needs of coaches within their
specic delivery contexts.
2.2. the sporting context
endurance sport is a broad church in which athletes
participate in events such as triathlon running and cycling 49.
over the last 20 years or so these sports have grown from being
niche into a worldwide multibilliondollar industry 50. whilst
athletes on traditional ltad pathways are important growth has
been driven by the emergence of participants dened as personal
referenced excellence pre by bailey et al. 51. they tend to
be nonelite participants with personally constructed motivations
such
as
completing
challenging
events
including
ironman
triathlon marathon or a distance cycling events in personal best
times.
the training environment in endurance sports affects the
coaching process because it is less constrained by facilities than
for many other sports. athletes usually train independently on
the roads in the hills and in the oceans without coaching
supervision. the popularity of mobile technology including
portable gps computers powermeters and heartrate monitors
to collect a wealth of data in endurance athletes has increasing
exponentially
52 53 within endurance sport. these data
primarily measure training load with a focus on frequency
duration and intensity 54. athletes then upload data to online
digital platforms such as strava or trainingpeaks for further
analysis.
athletes support an industry which has been created through
multidimensional consumerism involving the selling of products
such as sports equipment event entries and sports nutrition
products. the provision of coaching services also falls into this
market 55. forces acting within this market invariably inuence
what coaches wish to learn about. many endurance athletes are
selfcoached however a small but important minority will
engage the services of a coach to help them with their training 56.
in terms of technical performance facetoface coaching such
as on the pooldeck the running track or on a closedroad
circuit is arguably very important. however what endurance
coaches do and how they do it may be more driven by the
athlete wants rather than needs. whilst not conrmed by
research the coaching process is often far removed from
traditional
conceptualisations
of
coaching.
anecdotally
this
results in more digital and remote methods of coaching in which
the coachathlete relationship becomes a transactional one where
the coach delivers intangible services 57. these services are
often dictated by market demands i.e. the wants of their client
and what the clients beliefs are surrounding the role of a coach.
consequently such market demands and other context specic
discourses are likely to shape what coaches want to learn about.
additionally
the
recent
covid19
global
pandemic
and
subsequent
lockdown
has
resulted
in
coaches
outside
the
endurance sports domain using more online and digital coaching
practices during the lockdown periods 58. therefore lessons
learnt from endurance coaches operating in the digital world
may have broader application to other sports and education.
2.3. understanding context
coach learning and practice involves ever shifting complex
and
multifaceted
processes
59
60.
these
processes
are
inuenced by social forces and discourses that have potential to
legitimise or delegitimise certain ways of being 61. however a
western discourse towards reductionism and simple aphoristic
rules
often
results
in
research
conducted
through
narrow
theoretical disciplinary lenses focused on readily measurable
dimensions of coaching 8 62. such knowledge constructed
through oversimplication invariably inuences formal learning
programmes. we argue that research should be sensitive to
context and the often atheoretical nature of coaching in which
coaching
behaviours
are
inpart
emanations
of
the
social
structures in which they emerge. doing so may lead to a fuller
appreciation of the coaching process and context in which
intertwined and inseparable factors represent their complexity.
north 63 suggests that research requires a space for an
alternative approach to conceptualising coaching practice that
kirkland and cowley
10.3389fspor.2023.1147475
frontiers in sports and active living
frontiersin.org
seek to identify causal factors underpinning coaching outcomes
63. prior to seeing more interpretive and causal explanations
exploration and description of context is required. furthermore
research questions should be cocreated and designed through
complementary practice with stakeholders operating within the
context. whilst theory construction has its place in this research
process it is important to recognise that a large and overlapping
array of theories and components of theories can be used to
inuence applied practice 64 65. to be impactful research
must
also
be
accepted
adopted
and
complied
with
by
consumers such as endurance athletes coaches and practitioners
47 and presented in a way that makes sense to them.
2.4. research aims
therefore the aim of this study is to explore the coaching
context
and
learning
of
endurance
coaches
specically
to
produce a very realistic account of endurance sport coaching
which explores causal underpinnings 7. a cr framing is
employed with the intention to develop greater epistemological
congruency between research and applied coaching practice. this
study adds to the existing literature by potentially helping coach
educators and the wider endurance coaching industry to better
understand the market that they are operating within.
3. materials and methods
3.1. research perspective
a cr research ontology 7 66 64 was adopted with the
explicit
aim
of
contributing
new
knowledge
that
provides
practical solutions to coaching problems within endurance sport.
fundamental
to
a
cr
ontology
is
the
exploration
and
identication of causal tendencies rather than nding universal
truths to explain complexity. critical realists take a realist and
subjective stance believing that social structures can be real but
do not necessarily have a universal impact and that they cannot
necessarily be measured using simple empiricist methods 65.
critical realists also posit that the empiricist nature of causality
is wrong 69. the meaning of causality is philosophically
contested a debate that is covered by groff 70. from a cr
perspective in an openecologicalsystem causation is complex
hard to dene and emerges through the symbiotic relationship
between social reality and human agency. critical realists do not
argue
that
positivistic
and
constructivist
methods
are
unimportant
in
knowledge
construction
61.
rather
data
collected using such methods must be considered within the
wider social content to which it applies. in the context of this
study this meant that mixedmethods were employed and that
interpretation of the data was inherently realist subjective and
reexive 8. the primary researcher has been embedded 7 in
the endurance sports context as a coach chartered scientist
coach educator and preathlete with experience and expertise in
the area. he is an inside observer whose perspective infused
into the research process helping with participant recruitment
informing on what questions were asked how data were analysed
67 68 and interpreted. as an actor immersed in the endurance
world knowledge experience and judgement developed over
time allows for deep understanding of these social realities and
the potential causal mechanisms for them. this is consistent with
a cr ontology in which hidden causal structures 61 are
uncovered through indepth research which can be facilitated by
an insider perspective 69. however such voice means that it is
not possible to eliminate research biases 70 71. this was
balanced
by
the
collection
of
objective
data
which
was
interpreted
through
a
subjective
and
realist
lens.
for
trustworthiness and credibility purposes reexive processes were
adopted through discussions on interpretation with the second
author and in asking critical friends who are familiar with the
coaching context to review a draft manuscript. these processes
were vital to achieve the aim of the study to produce a realistic
account of the endurance context which whilst familiar to an
insider
goes
further
in
exploring
the
complex
causal
underpinnings of context specic coach learning. specically an
intention of this research was to provide foundational description
and interpretation of context. in doing so our hope is that
longitudinal type studies may emerge and from which deeper
clues to causality can be explored. this approach is consistent
with research model of bishop 72 in which descriptive data is
foundational for subsequent work to explore cause.
the cr approach in coaching allows for exploration of the
complexities of the coaching context which may provide a more
realistic accountable knowledge to coaching stakeholders 7.
this interpretation of a cr ontology resulted in a bricolage
approach being adopted to capture the context specic multi
layered multifaceted complexities of coaching 7 73. the aim
of doing so was to focus the mind on purposeful actions and
what the intended consequences 37 of the research are. in
other words the intention was not to construct new theories or
explore the data through a particular theoretical lens. rather it
was to recognise the inherently complex and hard to dene
nature of coaching and to present a narrative that is useful to
research endusers.
3.2. survey design
a cross sectional qualitative approach was used. the research
was part of a wider study involving four surveys with the data
collected using the online survey platform. this approach was
chosen as it is reported to provide rich qualitative data collection
in a quick costeffective manner. in this context the use of
surveys may generate comments that are more diverse than those
observed in focus groups or individual onetoone interviews
e.g. 78.
these surveys were designed during project conceptualisation
through the development of a stakeholder group led by the
primary author. this group enabled us to gain a range of
perspectives and opinions particularly on what questions to ask
and their relevance to the context of stakeholders 76 77.
kirkland and cowley
10.3389fspor.2023.1147475
frontiers in sports and active living
frontiersin.org
whilst the approaches used were relatively consistent with a delphi
consensus method 78 they involved more informal adhoc and
organic processes including consultation with sports coaches
consultants in coach development data scientists and other
research endusers involved in endurance sport within the
primary authors network. the nal survey emerged through
iterative renement involving group members. demographic and
sources

knowledge
questions
were
adapted
from

79.
these
demographic
questions were built upon using quantitative data from the state
of endurance coaching report 80 an unpublished industry
report. further elements of the survey were drawn from the
themes identied by mccormick et al. 81 in relation to the
psychological demands experienced by endurance athletes. this
adhoc approach to survey design was used in recognition of the
complexity of coaching and learning and the practicalities of
conducting practical research. themes for the questions related
to demographics coaching process and learning.
prior to being administered the questionnaires were reviewed
extensively for face and content validity by a by a panel of
experts as aforementioned including sport industry stakeholders.
this was then piloted with a small group of coaches and athletes.
whilst adding to the complexity of the research process such
stakeholder engagement was viewed as fundamental to the
research philosophy and study design 78. this cocreation
added to challenges in study design analysis and interpretation
of data. however it took priority over a narrower theoretical
framing to add ecological validity and generalisability within
relevant contexts.
3.3. recruitment and procedures
coaches and
athletes
were recruited
for the
study in
recognition that athlete perspectives needs and wants inuence
coach learning and practice. there were two surveys for the
coaches 1 a primarily quantitative survey and 2 a primarily
qualitative survey. with the rst survey we wanted to maximise
completion rate through not making the survey too long. on the
nal page of this survey there was a link to the 2nd qualitative
survey which could be completed by participants if they wished
to. this was to avoid oversaturation and the practicalities of
analysing large volumes of qualitative data. there was also a
survey for athletes who had engaged an individual coach and one
for noncoached athletes including those coached within a club
without individualised coaching support.
the study was approved by the relevant university ethics
committee according to the declaration of helsinki. following
institutional approval purposive sampling was employed where
coaches and athletes were contacted through social media in
which the primary researcher used his links with industry
national governing bodies ngb and highprole athletes to
reach
a
broad
international
audience.
snowball
sampling
occurred 78 through sharing on social media. data collection
was completed prior to covid19.
3.4. quantitative data
quantitative data were downloaded from online survey and
analysed within microsoft excel spreadsheets. where data is
presented as a ranking score these were ordinal rankings which
were numerically normalised to allow crosscomparison between
participant groups. for example responses of very important
important not important not important at all were assigned
numerical values from 2 to 2 respectively were summed for
all responses provided and then expressed as a percentage of the
maximum score possible.
3.5. qualitative data
qualitative data were downloaded from online survey and
then
organised
and
analysed
using
nvivo
qualitative
solution
research
2017.
a
complementary
approach
was
followed throughout the analyses. the primary authors expertise
in endurance sport allowed him to immerse in the data adding
depth and richness to the data gathered 82. themes were
generated and developed from the data using the six stages of
reexive thematic analysis as a framework 83. both inductive
and
deductive
approaches
were
considered
as
these
lend
themselves to this revised reexive approach 84.
this process started with the familiarisation of the data where
the text were read and reread. initial codes were then generated
using nvivo 11 qualitative solutions research 2017. patterns
were then identied amongst these codes to generate themes.
these were then reviewed against the entire qualitative data set.
themes were then dened before writing up the data using the
extracts that were relevant to the initial questions.
4. results and discussion
the aim of this study was to explore the coaching context and
learning of endurance coaches. the intention was not to provide
irrefutable truths on endurance coaching practice 64 but to
provide insight into an emerging and complex coaching context.
by doing so a substantial contribution to knowledge has been
made by presenting a form of coaching that is different to how it
has traditionally been conceptualised. this coaching has been
shaped
by
a
wider
milieu
in
which
an
inextricably
interconnected array of factors may inuence coach and athlete
interactions in the digital age.

change can be more effectively developed 85. whilst market
segmentation has not typically been employed in coaching
research sport england recently used market segmentation tools
86 to help stakeholders better understand the behaviours of
different segments of society in the hope of growing participation
levels. as part of research process stakeholders were engaged
with the intention of breaching the divide between research and
applied practice 5 62.
nine thousand eight hundred and three participants completed

depending on where in the world participants lived. the usa

importantly
whilst
there
was
considerable variation in income level athletes tended fall within
higher abc1 income brackets. further participants tended to be
educated to graduate and postgraduated educated levels as
shown in table 1. it should be noted that the noncoached

and

contributed
to
understanding
of
the
coaching context demographics within the sport and provides
clues surrounding the latent coaching market.
we were guided by the work of bailey et al. 49 collins and
collins 87 and the uk sport athlete performance framework
in determining athlete segmentscategorisation for athletes. these
segment categorisations terms were rened in consultation with
stakeholders to ensure they were appropriate for an international
audience and are shown in table 2. the predominant segment
for
both
coached
and
noncoached
athletes
was
personal
referenced excellence pre identied as a group of adult
athletes who are motivated to be the best they can be but who
may not necessarily have the talent aspirations or agency to
move to the next level 88. the data in table 3 represents the
relative percentage of athletes they coached in each segment
recognising that many coaches worked across several segments.
the athlete demographic suggests that most are educated
professionals who are highly driven and have demanding work

see
sport
england segments. whilst the segments of bailey et al. 49 give
clues about the motivations of athletes it is suggested that the
wider sporting milieu will inuence what expectations they have
on a coach and how these expectations are interconnected with
the coaching process. for example the coachathlete relationship
within the presegment can be a more of a transactional one of
service provision rather than being a twoway relationship.
furthermore group coached sessions are constrained by the
availability of facilities such as swimming pools running tracks
and closedroad circuits for cycling. this is reected in how
athletes train regardless of whether they are coached or not.

anecdotally younger athletes particularly those on long term
athletic development ltad pathways are far more likely to be
coached in a traditional sense in which coaches observe and
feedback on performance.
table 2 shows the main sports of the study participants.
interestingly this data highlights that triathletes are more likely
to be coached than cyclists or runners. whilst the reasons for
this phenomenon are unclear triathlon is a relatively new sport
in which tradition is less imbedded and culturally more open to
coaching and innovation.
4.2. coach education and learning
the relevance of coaching context is technology redening
the coaching process?
cooper and allen 89 suggest that coaching involves social
interaction involving at least two people a coach and an athlete.
these interactions result in sharing of information to guide the
actions of both actors 93 with the aim of improving the
athletes performance. the present research is important because
we show that the coaching process including planning delivery
of sessions and communication is fundamentally shaped by
technology
without
necessitating
direct
coachathlete
social
interaction. table 4 shows that coaches spent very little time
delivering
traditional
facetoface
coaching.
however
the
standarddeviation values show that there are large differences in
the time spent on specic coaching tasks. this is likely to be
because
there
is
no
onesizetsall
conceptualisation
of
endurance coaching. rather we suggest it is a cottage industry
in which coaches typically work independently on a parttime
basis and in a way that ts around their life demands and interests.
similarly the income level and age of athlete preathletes is
consistent with the market segments from sport england 86 of
participants who are income rich and time poor. this is reected
in the fact that 70 of coached athletes train alone or in small
groups 16 with only 11 training in a club environment.
from a coaching perspective such unmediated training limits the
possibilities for realtime feedback to assess the quality of
training. rather the preferred method to develop feedback loops
is through the integration of data collected using digital devices
such as gps powermeters and heartrate monitors which are
uploaded to web platforms for analysis by the coach. this data
constitutes the main type of feedback coaches ask for table 5
thus reducing training to a primarily metabolic event with less
focus
on
psychosocial
technical
and
tactical
aspects
of
performance. whilst there are exceptions the coaching process is
often reduced to online training prescription and data sharing.
whilst the reasons may be complex it is suggested that
technology is reducing coaching to a measurementinduced
myopic
process
in
which
psychoemotional
elements
of
performance could be neglected 60. a coach can prescribe
additional
technical
content
performance
criteria
and
psychological skills to practice the athlete must be able to
benchmark their performance against criteria established by the
coach 94. doing so requires advanced conceptualisation of the
coaching process and the ability to foster an effective coach
athlete feedback loop. however coaches in this study do not
tend to rank these factors as important or interesting and many
are unlikely to engage in such practices as a result.
some may argue that training prescription is not coaching
because it does not involve giving direct technical advice 91.
furthermore without facetoface contact social interaction may
be limited by asynchronous engagement using web feedback.
this could mean that social rewards and emotions may be
limited. this is reected in coaching beliefs in which there is a
common perception that athletes tend to be poor at providing
qualitative feedback an area that was discussed with stakeholders
in the design of this project. one reason may be that data from
many devices can be interfaced with and uploaded to the web
automatically but qualitative feedback requires athletes to take
time to reect on action 92. whilst 33 of coached athletes

believed that they provided highquality feedback the remainder
recognised that they could do better. using an openended
question athletes were asked how their coach could help them
provide better feedback and seven themes were identied as
shown in figure 1. these themes suggest that coaches need to
develop skills in eliciting quality feedback such as through
questioning and being able to provide goodquality feedback
themselves. in the digital environment good quality qualitative
feedback is essential to augment biophysical metrics and in
building effective coachathlete relationships. such data replaces
the coaches eyes and ears in the feedback loop. however there
is there is little precedent on how best to engage in meaningful
coachathlete dialogue and social connection in the endurance
sport digital environment.
humans learn through thinking and knowing and such
cognitive abilities are best developed through osmotic social
interaction and dialogue with others 93 97. however we are at
an
epoch
in
evolution
because
digital
technology
has
revolutionised how people communicate interact and learn.
covid19 has accelerated these processes. whilst we are always
connected mezirow 95 suggests that adult learning is best
achieved
through
communities
which
engage
in
rationale
discourse and action. however technology appears to present
fewer opportunities for meaningful social interaction in which
selfreection and critical thinking may be compromised. this is
important within the context of this study in which coaches
stated that learning through experience experience as an athlete
and reecting on past coaching are most important to them in
developing their coaching. however brookeld 96 suggests it
is enormously difcult to stand outside of ones own interpretive
frameworks through an act of ones own mental volition. if the
coachingprocess occurs primarily in front of a computer screen
then this is likely to have negative implications on reection and
reexive learning. for example there has been a tendency in
educational settings to use technology as a new type of vessel for
information transference without considering the implications to
and mechanisms of learning in such an environment 97. this
challenge applies equally to remote coachathlete relationships.
whilst human interaction rather than virtual connection is
vital to create and share learning experiences 93 the digital
environment means that such interaction is often removed from
the coaching process in an endurance sport context. further in a
market driven economy preathletes have greater autonomy and
fewer constraints in how they choose to be coached. if these
athletes consider that prescription of training the analysis of and
subsequent feedback on training is coaching then academic
debates surrounding what coaching is or is not and the coaching
process
are
inconsequential.
notwithstanding
traditional
conceptualisations of what coaching is 91 have probably
inuenced what ngbs have delivered on their programmes. for
example to coach individual athletes in the uk coaches typically
needed a ukcc level 3 qualication. these frameworks require
coaches complete level 1 and level 2 qualications which
focused on facetoface coaching and group session design. the
data in table 6 are interesting in this regard. planning and
prescribing endurance training was viewed as the most important
thing to learn about for endurance coaches. despite believing
that online and desktop coaching software was viewed as more
important than psychological elements of performance coaches
believed that coach education had poorly prepared them to use

technology.
therefore
commercial
providers
such
as
trainingpeaks who have vested interests have lled a gap in the
market to support coaches with technological advances. from a
neoliberal standpoint we suggest that the market has greater
inuence over what is considered to be coaching than academics
or ngbs have. this market has decided that coaches who plan
and prescribe training and who primarily interact through web
platforms constitutes coaching. we reiterate that we believe from
a cr perspective that sports coaching cannot be reducible to
simple description explanation 7 or denition. however the
suggestion from cooper and allen 89 that coaching involves
social interaction involving at least two people a coach and an
athlete and is usually focused on performance enhancement
infers that coaching using web technology is coaching.
furthermore technology such as gps power meters and
online coaching platforms have allowed the precoaching market
to grow. technology now presents a threat to this coaching
market in which articial intelligence ai algorithms are already
being used to analyse data and to design organic training
programmes 98 99. in the present study noncoached athletes
stated that cost was the greatest barrier to being coached.
however fister et al. 98 suggests ai can overcome this barrier
in which those want more can augment ai with a real coach.
interestingly their algorithm was built using readily quantiable
biophysical components of performance. whilst it seems unlikely
that such ai can build the type of interpersonal relationships
that contribute to coaching effectiveness our study suggests that
many coaches and athletes do not value such interpersonal
relationships as much as qualitative data driven coaching. rather
the wider coaching market in endurance sports is technology
driven and more dependent on athlete wants rather than an
idealistic vision of what constitutes effective coaching. therefore
the sporting discourse must be shaped through promoting a
more complete coaching process and psychosocial elements of
performance.
in the qualitative section of this study coaches were asked to
describe what they thought their coaching role involved. as
shown in table 7 the coaches presented a wider perspective of
their role. this was reected in the themes relating to athlete
outcomes and where the coaching role dominated suggesting
that many coaches recognise a more complete coaching process.
this highlights that coaches want to help athletes actualise their
goals and provide a service of value. in terms of motivation in a
cottage industry selfsatisfaction through helping others is very
important. however they must also generate income through
attracting and retaining clients in sufcient numbers. therefore
having a limited physical coachathlete interfaces and using
digital
technologies
may
bring
practical
efciencies
to
the
coaching process especially as worklife balance was reported to
be a challenge for many coaches. however johnson 100
suggests that similar instructional technologies in an educational
environment change power dynamics in which the person who
pays the bill is the gure of authority. in a digital environment
where the age of athletes may be similar to their coach such a
power dynamic may not exist in the rst place. rather athletes
can hide in a virtual environment deciding if and when they
wish to provide feedback and what type of coaching service they
want.
4.3. exploration of the digital world on
coach learning
it is common for studies to recommend that coaches require
better training and resources to enhance their coaching practice.
however such recommendations are based on the assumption
that
coaches
value
and
engage
with
mediated
learning
experiences. rather we suggest that learning of endurance
coaches typically occurs beyond discrete panopticons and is often
driven
by
web
technology.
this

network simple and effective interventions to deal with complex
pedagogical problems are unlikely to exist. this study shows that
global brands and commercial sources dominate the information
choices made by coaches. traditionally recognised providers of
coach education such as ngbs and evidencebased academic
sources continue to inuence the wider discourse in endurance
sport 27. however their content is not necessarily context
specic or reective of the coaching process of endurance
coaches. rather the wider discourse is focussed towards selling
tangible products intangible services and is biophysically biased
thus
neglecting
more
factors
relating
to
coaching
and
performance enhancement. whilst unmediated learning suggests
a relative degree of learning autonomy there appears to be an
illusion of choice in what coaches want to learn about. therefore
inuencing and working with inuential brands who present
what learning choices are available to coaches may be more
effective
than
developing
learning
strategies
for
individual
coaches 102. if they recognise that they have vested interests in
promoting more effective coaching such brands could become
mechanisms for change. idealistic conceptualisations of the
coaching process are unlikely to be helpful in this regard. rather
shifting the context specic biophysical bias towards a more
holistic view of performance enhancement which has social
connection at its heart may play a role in coaches being able to
engage with and retain athletes as customers. thus they can add
more value within a complex and rapidly adapting market.
in such a dataed coaching context technological innovation
offers valuable tools to facilitate virtual connection particularly for
planning analysing and prescribing training 103. however we
suggest that such tools threaten deeper social connection and
more holistic approaches to the coaching.
in facetoface coaching feedback is gathered in a complex
fashion in which both coaches and athletes continually reect in
action 92 as a result of different sensory inputs and outputs.
this is reected in the traditional coaching process models such
as franks et al. 104 and magill 105 and concepts such as
evaluative and corrective feedback 106. this is different in
the remote environment because a coach is often not present
with their athlete during training or competition. without
sensory feedback collected by the coach for example through
observation and with less opportunities for the athlete to
immediately express their own intrinsic feedback 107 coaches
and athletes need to develop a range of feedback mechanisms to
develop
effective
feedback
loops
typically
using
digital
technology. limitations and opportunities of different digital
communication mediums are discussed elsewhere 108 109.
remote coaching reframes the coaching process from the
traditional instruction motivation and feedback techniques based
on inaction reection towards a greater focus on reecting
on action 92. this changes the social dynamic in the coach
athlete relationship in which is more reliant on web coaching
platforms. such communication may be augmented through
other digital technologies such as whatsapp messenger or text
messages. more traditional facetoface coaching interpersonal
behaviours are critical to developing trust and connectedness
110 114. we also suggest that because remote coaching is a
relatively new phenomenon in endurance sport many coaches
will not have experienced being coached themselves in this
environment.
furthermore
the
biophysical
bias
within
the
context could mean that many coaches lack the knowledge and
experience to create effective social relationships with their athletes.
moreover a coachathlete relationship conducted via the web
may result in a sense of psychoemotional detachment in which
capacity for sophisticated interpersonal interaction is limited. if
this is the case there are likely to be negative implications which
limit the learning of the coach and the performance of the
athlete.
from
a
cr
perspective
description
of
context
is
important in guiding future research to explore cause and causal
assumptions. we suggest that an important focus of such
research is to explore social connections between coaches and
athletes in remote coaching environments. preliminary ndings
by britton 115 suggests that the duration of the coachathlete
relationship is a good proxy of coaching effectiveness and that
themes relating to social connection as shown in figure 2 are key.

coach learning is often presented as something to be facilitated
rather than a complex process of social osmosis in which coach
behaviour is shaped by their environment 112115. this is
reected in our data in which coaches value unmediated
learning experiences such as learning through experience and
selfreection table 8 more than mediated ones 14. in

critics of this certication which is built upon a closedsystem

suggest
that

services.
this

is
important
because
the

collection demonstrating rapid growth and highlighting the
importance of brand in engagement.
werthner and trudel 14 suggest that cognitive structure a
network of knowledge feelings and emotions inuences what
coaches pay attention to and learn from. this suggestion is not
inconsistent with hattie and donoghues 2 skill will and
thrill model of learning whereby establishing what the learner
currently knows. the data collected within this study has been
interpreted to suggest that that wider sociocultural and economic
milieus in endurance sport inuence the type of information
coaches implicitly or actively consume. the inuential work of
werthner and trudel 14 identied three types of learning
situations mediated unmediated and internal. however we
suggest that it is not the situations or sources that are important
perse but rather is the quality of resources that emanate from
them and how they shape coaching practice. in the present
study coaches were asked to provide examples of sources of
information they paid attention to as shown in table 9.
coaches presented a broad array of primarily digital sources
including
websites
and
magazines.
these
tended
to
be
commercial in nature aimed at a general endurance sport
audience rather than a specic coaching population. the sources
in table 9. suggest that endurance coaches knowledge is
constructed through multiple cognitive biases towards shiny
things 116 and is biophysically orientated. brand is important
whether that of individual gurus ngbs or commercial entities
suggesting a potential susceptibility to authority bias. basic
content analysis of these sources suggest that content is often
designed to promote clicks or to sell products and that quality
of material is highly variable. ngb and associations and industry
brands and gurus all present similar content e.g. equipment
reviews nutrition articles training plansmethodologies elite
athlete stories and quick xes. this is presumably because
efcacy can only be judged through web analytics and what

proves to be popular. we suggest that such engagement is likely to
inuence future content more so than how effective it is in
enhancing learning. this has important implications to coach
education. for example ngb coach education programmes in
the uk have key performance indicators relating to sustainability
and income generation. this is likely to result in mediated
learning events being made more accessible in bitesized
chunks. income will primarily be generated by content that
coaches will engage with independent of whether it will make
them a better coach or not.
the use of academic journals was prevalent as a learning source
within the study however there was also an obvious biophysical
bias in the sources used such as pubmed and the journal of
applied physiology. sport psychology and coaching periodicals
were noticeable by their absence despite a psychology dominant
perspective within coaching practice literature 61. this suggests
inuences from a wider discourse in endurance sport in which
there is a bias towards readily quantiable and controllable
factors and avoidance of psychosocial factors 60 117.
the bias continued into what coaches perceived to be
important in which the top5 highest ranked factors in table 6
were biophysically related too. whilst technology and innovation
were midranked in terms of coaching importance coaches
found this area to be most interesting. this may reect the fact
that these relate to tangible shiny goods 55 that are marketed
extensively in the sources where coaches access information.
whilst some sources use evidencebased content many more do
not. although coaches felt relatively well prepared by their
training to plan and prescribe training they felt unprepared to
use coaching software in how to prevent injury using research
and training metrics by their training. they typically believed
that planning and prescribing training was the most important
aspect of their coaching role with them prioritising biophysical
training metrics above mental and psychological aspects of
performance. this is consistent with the views of kiely 60 in
which deterministic models are used to periodise training whilst
neglecting less readily quantiable aspects of performance. such
biases are likely to distort coaches views on the coaching
process.
for example
whilst
many
preendurance
athletes
experience negative psychological stressors related to training and
competition 81 and would value additional support from their
coach in this regard data from the present study suggested that
coaches could do a better job in this area. in a followup study
mccormick et al. 47 stated that dissemination of relevant
simple concise and contextualised psychological knowledge to
coaches may benet their practice. however if coaches perceive
psychology to be less important and less interesting than physical
components of performance then they are unlikely to engage
even if they will become a better coach as a result. therefore it
is recommended that disciplinary researchers are cautious
about recommending
coaches need further education in a
particular area e.g. psychology antidoping nutrition without
rstly considering where the subject ts within context specic
coach interests.
perhaps a slow process of evolution rather than revolution is
likely to result in learning and behavioural change 118.
promoting such evolutionary processes through research requires
not only a deep understanding of the context of learning but it
also
requires
alternative
research
methods
to
understand
stakeholder needs and buyin 61 81. for example the scientic
community has been slow to validate or critically evaluate allen
and coggans 119 functional threshold power ftp and its
associated metrics see table 6. despite this lack of scientic
evidence these metrics are an important part of the coaching
process relating to planning prescribing and analysing endurance

data in marketleading software such as strava trainingpeaks and
zwift. ftp is often discussed in quasiscientic terms has been
extensively adopted by endurance gurus professional athletes
and the wider media. methods with a greater scientic evidence
base are available 120. however for coaches to want to learn
and adopt them into practice would require a shifting of shared
customary beliefs about training software would have to be able
to accommodate different coaching practices and there would
have to be nancial advantage to those who hold power over the
discourse 121. doing so is probably unrealistic.
crucial to the learning of coaches is their ability to be able to
interpret information from a vast array of sources. there are
endless unmediated learning opportunities with information of
varying quality. whilst learning is very challenging to measure it
is a neutral process in which coaches must think andor act
differently for learning to occur. moon 13 suggests there is a
tendency to regard learning as happening only when the
learning is in a direction that is approved or desired. although
it is useful to know where coaches access their information from
it is more important to recognise these sources are mere
representations
of
the
knowledge
of
others.
further
such
knowledge is often biased by vested interests the need to sell
something
or presented using
editorial
styles
designed
for
information consumption. that is not to say that some of the
sources may not contain credible content. rather for learning to
occur coaches must be sufciently intellectually skilled to ensure
they do not simply accept information as true or to blindly
accept advice provided without deeper cognitive processing. in
other words they need to be critical consumers of information
126. the study of koh et al. 127 is one of a very few to have
explored the use of the internet as a learning source for coaches
in a youth soccer context. these coaches appeared to access
similar types of sources which they deemed to be credible
including federations highprole clubs and coaches. they also
used their experiences as players as a frame of reference to
decide if the information was valuable to their coaching practice
or not. koh et al. 127 suggested that discerning the credibility
of the sources was a challenge as was coaches primarily engaging
with material that conrmed preexisting beliefs. our data
suggests
that
academic
attainment
does
not
offer
enough
protection against such bias in which selfsourced and random
browsing results in coaches engaging with information that is
consistent with the wider discourse. rather powerful forces push
them towards assimilation with market driven agendas and a
learning statusquo.
4.4. limitations
whilst this study has contributed to knowledge of learning in
the
context
of
endurance
sport
no
research
is
without
limitations. it is recognised that this research was part of a wider
exploratory project seeking to better understand the coaching
practice and learning of endurance coaches. this is a critical part
of the research process in which the purpose is to identify real
world problems and issues that athletes and coaches face 72.
consistent with the recommendations of those who advocate
methods to promote impact e.g. 62 72 77 we engaged
beyond the research community. such an approach came with
several challenges. firstly holding together a tightly framed and
cohesive narrative whilst retaining the complex nature of the
coaching environment was highly challenging. this paper study
presents an evidence guided and reexive view from a sports
coaching coachs perspective. therefore there is no claim made
that the research is free from bias. however an important role of
the second author was to check and challenge interpretation.
the study narrative attempts to tackle complexity in a broad cr
conceptualisation of endurance coaching practice 61 exploring
potential interacting factors which inuence causation. this
includes
considering
the
interaction
between
multiple
stakeholders and actors. the desire was not to provide a new
conceptualisation of coaching but to shift the orientation of
thinking of the reader 13. a more tightly focussed objective
lens may have resulted in something that was easier to grasp but
it may have failed to capture the essence of the coaching context
and been of little practical effect 123. secondly as the main
market for coaches we chose a prefocussed dialogue whilst
potentially diverting analyses from other segments such as ere
youthdevelopment
and
recreational
sport.
however
these
segments have been explored extensively and were less likely to
add new knowledge or debate surrounding endurance sport.
furthermore comment on the manuscript was sought from
industry professionals prior to submission and there was broad
consensus that it offered a fair representation of context.
whilst there are commonalities with the coaching process
described by cooper and allen 89 in which coachathlete
interactions shape learning no attempt was made to present a
unied theory of coach learning or the coaching process.
however it would be interesting to explore this process using
more indepth qualitative approaches. finally because of the way
participants were recruited a sampling bias may have occurred
in which participants using digital technology were more likely
to have completed the survey 124. we attempted to overcome
this limitation by engaging with major ngbs to help promote
the survey with their members. however even with strong links
to these organisations there was an apparent reticence by some
to assist. within the uk we suggest that such reticence may be
inuenced
by
the
fact
that
focus
of
coach
development
programmes is often driven by rhetoricbased policies rather
than evidencebased needs of ngb member coaches.
5. conclusions and future directions
the ndings of the study provide valuable insights into the
coaching context of endurance coaches what they do and how
they learn. through presenting a broad narrative our results
illustrate a complex relationship between how coaches and
athletes interact in an environment shaped by technology and
market forces. we also suggest that ngbs are constrained by
national boundaries and the agendas of those who funds them in
the provision of coach education. furthermore unmediated

learning sources are more inuential than mediated learning
provided from within such panipticons. therefore in line with
the recommendations of stoszkowski et al. 127 we suggest that
mediated coach education should support coaches to lter the
noise within their coaching context. to do so requires critical
thinking skills independent conrmation of the facts and the
recognition that the answer to most coaching questions is it
depends. endurance coaches must also learn to recognise the
biophysical biases in their practices and an apparent myopia
towards psychosocial elements of coaching. further empirical
studies exploring the inuence of unmediated learning sources
on coaching practice may be merited. doing so could give
broader insight into how people learn in the digital age. further
investigations to explore how coachathlete relationships develop
using
webtechnology
and
what
inuence
they
have
on
performance is also merited.
