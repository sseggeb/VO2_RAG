there is a growing interest in the scientic literature for reporting topclass endurance
athletes training programs. this case study reports on the training program of a world
class male triathlete preparing to compete in the tokyo 2020 olympic games. a
macrocycle of 43 weeks is presented. the triathlete performed 14.74  3.01 h of
weekly endurance training volume. training intensity distribution tid was 81.93 
6.747.16  2.0310.91  6.90 for zones 1 low intensity vt1 2 moderate
intensity vt1vt2 and 3 high intensity vt2 respectively. pyramidal tid model is
observed during the initial stages of the periodization and polarized tid model is observed
at the end of the macrocycle. the triathletes peak vo2 was increased by 20 on cycling
and by 14 on running. peak power was increased by 3.13 on cycling test and peak
speed by 9.71 on running test. finally the triathlete placed 12th in olympic distance and
10th in mixed relay in tokyo 2020 olympic games.

introduction
the summer olympic games are organized every 4 years with a great socioeconomic impact since
they have an audience of more than three billion viewers around the world yan 2020. triathlon is
an endurance sport that combines swimming road cycling and distance running performed in that
order itu 2021. this sport has been part of the olympic program since sydney 2000 with the
olympic distance discipline 1.5 km swimming 40 km cycling and 10 km running. tokyo 2020 has
been the rst edition to include the mixed relay format where the four members of each participating team
i.e two women and two men each complete a full super sprint distance triathlon 0.3 km swimming 8 km
cycling and 2 km running. 55 triathletes participated in the olympic distance of the tokyo 2020 olympic
games previously qualied according to different criteria 2 years before the event. a maximum of three
triathletes from the same country can take part in the individual event in both male and female categories.
regarding to the mixed relay race a total of 18 teams took part in the premiere of this modality in the
olympic games itu 2021. besides tokyo 2020 olympic games were considered particularly hard due to
the extreme weather conditions. meteorological data indicated that weather condition were both hot
2628c and humid 8789 during the triathlon races. such conditions affect the endurance
performance and increase the risk of exertional heat illness racinais et al. 2015a.

there are limited reports about training characteristics and
physiological performance of toplevel triathletes millet and
vleck 2000 millet et al. 2003. mujika 2014 described
training characteristics of a female triathlete in her preparation
to the london 2012 olympic games. later this author presented
the physiological prole and the training plan for a world
champion male paratriathlete mujika et al. 2015. however to
the best of our knowledge no case report has been published of
world class male triathlete preparing for the olympic games. thus
the aim of this case study is to describe the training characteristics
and the physiological prole of a worldclass male triathlete who
participated in both the olympic distance event and the mixed
relay event at the tokyo 2020 olympic games.
materials and methods
characteristics of the triathlete
this case study received the authorization from the alicante
university ethics committee ua20170411 expedient. written
consent was obtained from a 29 yearsold male triathlete who has
competed in world triathlon series since 2012 obtaining 20 podiums
and four victories in international triathlon union itu races. he
nished in fourth position of the world triathlon series wts
ranking in 2019 obtaining the qualication for the tokyo 2020
olympic games. he also competed in rio 2016 where he placed 18th.

sweetenham and atkinson 2003 muoz et al. 2014. the
rst repetition of the protocol was 20 s slower than his
personal best in 200 m registered the previous week in a
training session and then every repetition was 4 s faster until
the sixth and for the seventh repetition the triathlete was told to
perform to swim as fast as possible. blood lactate bla mmoll
samples from the ear lobe were analyzed with a portable lactate
analyzer lactate scout 4 ekf diagnostics germany. the
criteria to determine training zones were follows in swimming a
blood lactate 0.5 mmoll increase for rst lactate threshold lt1
1 mmoll increase for second lactate threshold lt2 and
89 mmoll for maximal aerobic speed mas beneke 2003
jamnick et al. 2020.
incremental tests of volitional exhaustion were used to
determine training zones in cycling and running. a ramp
protocol was used for cycling on a roller cycleops the
hammer united states starting at 150 w and increasing 5 w
each 12 s muoz et al. 2014. the triathlete used his own bike
bh aerolight spain and his power meter rotor
2inpower road spain to perform the test. the cycling tests
were performed in the same room with the same temperature
20c. the running test was performed on a 400 m homologated
track university of alicante facilities. the triathlete started at
13.9 kmh and increased 0.3 kmh every 200 m brue 1985. the
triathlete uses the same running shoes in both test asics
metaspeed edge japan. weather conditions were a temperature
of 19c and a wind of 7.5 kmh for the rst running test while
they were a temperature of 15c and a wind of 5.4 kmh for the
second test.
running and cycling tests were conducted using a portable
gasexchange analyzer cosmed k4b 2 italy. the following
variables were measured during the test oxygen uptake  vo2
pulmonary ventilation  ve ventilatory equivalent for oxygen
ve vo2 ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide  ve vco2
and endtidal partial pressure of oxygen peto2 and carbon
dioxide petco2. maximal oxygen uptake vo2max was
recorded

obtained
for
any
continuous 1 min period. the rst ventilatory threshold vt1
was determined using the criteria of an increase in both ve vo2
and peto2 with no increase in ve vco2 whereas the second
ventilatory threshold vt2 was determined using the criteria of
an increase in both vevo2 and ve vco2 and a decrease in
petco2. two independent observers identied vt1 and vt2.
heart rate hr was continuously monitored during the test
using a heart rate meter suunto spartan finland. later a
range of hr and power or velocity for each training zone was
established. eight training zones were calculated to be more
precise prescribing the intensity of the training sessions. these
training zones reported both internal load hr and external load
speed or power data cejuela and estevelanao 2011 2020.
besides a rpe scale 110 was related to these training zones.
additionally the skinner and mclellan triphasic model with
three training zones was followed to present tid and training
load distribution tld data.
anthropometric measurements were performed following

exible anthropometric steel tape holtain united kingdom.
the sum of skinfolds was calculated as well as muscular mass was
determined using the method of lee et al. 2000.
control of the training load
cycling power data were measured using a power meter located
on the crank rotor 2inpower road spain. the triathlete
recorded all cycling and running training sessions with his hr

software
trainingpeakswko5 united states. hr and rpe were
used mainly for low intensity workouts in running and
cycling. speed and power were also used to control moderate
and high intensity workouts in running and cycling. rpe and the
medium pace for 100 m were used to control swimming
workouts considering the different training zones obtained in
the swimming lactate test. besides the triathlete was lling
personal training logs with the information recorded regarding
the amount of time spent in each training zone and with other
subjective information such as hours of sleep and with the
subjective load scale ecss in spanish from 0 to 5 cejuela
and estevelanao 2011 cejuela and estevelanao 2020.
execution speed was controlled in strength training using a
linear encoder vitruve spain. most of the training
workouts was supervised by the coach of the triathlete rc or
an assistant coach ss or at.
the objective load scale ecos in spanish training load
quantication method was applied cejuela and estevelanao
2011 cejuela and estevelanao 2020. briey the ecos were
calculated by multiplying the time minutes that the triathlete
spends in every training zone 18 during the workout by a
scoring value between 1 and 50 depending on the training zone
and by a specic factor of 1.0 0.75 or 0.5 for running swimming or
cycling respectively. this methodology seems the most appropriate for
triathlon because it compares different endurance activities attending
the different degrees of muscle damage energy cost effort densities
and differences at the ability of maintaining technique in the three
segments cejuela and estevelanao 2011 cejuela and estevelanao
2020. a specic software all in your mind training system
mexico was used to calculate the ecos throughout the training plan.
main characteristics of the training period
the triathlete trained with the same methodology in the 2019 and
2020 seasons. the goal was competing in the wts in 2019 where
he ranked fourth. due to covid19 there were no wts in 2020.
this season he was spanish championship.
the training period for the tokyo olympic games consisted
out of 43 weeks which were grouped in a total of 14 mesocycles.
the main part of the training was developed in alicante spain
or in talavera de la reina spain. besides two training camps of
4 weeks were performed in the highaltitude performance center
of sierra nevada 2340 m altitude spain. simulated altitude
sessions ialtitude spain were performed at three times of the
season daily from week 810 from week 1416 and from week
3640. the duration of the sessions was from 45 to 90 min and
the range of altitude exposures was from 3500 to 6000 m. the
rst physiological tests took place at week 6 swimming and 7
cycling and running test. the second physiological tests were
performed at week 24. a traditional periodization was used in the
rst part of the season. the general preparatory period was
performed from week 114. these weeks were characterized
by an increasing of training volume progressively being the
most part of the training sessions around vt1. the specic
preparatory period was performed from week 1530 including
the two training camps in highaltitude performance center. the
rst one was from week 1821 and the second one was from week
2730. the main goal of training period consisted in develop
higher training zones nearer to race intensity vo2max and vt2.
usually transitions trainings were performed twice weekly with
intensities nearer to the competition around vt2. the triathlete
also took part in two competitions during this period in order to
training one sprint duathlon at week 24 1st and one olympic
triathlon at week 28 1st. the rst competitive period lasted
5 weeks from week 31 to week 35 and included two olympic
distance triathlon world series wts. the rst one in yokohama
week 32 where the triathlete ranked at 14th position and the
second one in leeds week 35 where the triathlete ranked at 4th
position. a mixed relay olympic qualication event were also
performed at week 33 at lisbon where the team of spain ranked
at 6th. a tapering period took place during this competitive
period. the aim goal of these weeks was reduced training load to
promote the supercompensation of the triathlete and improve the
recovery. this was mainly done through the training volume
reduction. high intensity training sessions were maintained
during this period. a 5 weeks training block from week 36 to
week 40 of specic preparation to tokyo olympic games was
conducted after these three competitions. training load was
increased again during this period. tapering period to the
olympic games was performed during weeks 41 and 42
through the decrease of the training load in an exponential
manner in order to promote supercompensation. besides
these weeks included the adaptation period to the tokyo jet
lag. finally the triathlete competed in both the olympic distance
triathlon event and the mixed relay triathlon event at week 43.
the triathlete also performed strength training throughout his
preparation to the olympic games. as a general rule two weekly
strength training sessions were performed during the most part of
the season. multijoint exercises both upper and lower body
were performed by the triathlete. training loads progressed from
55 to 75 of 1rm performing from two to four sets per
exercise. the rep range was from four to eight reps per set
always working away from muscle failure and with a loss of speed
not
greater
than
15
within
the
set.
furthermore

complementary exercises were carried out three or 4 days a week
after the swimming training sessions. these exercises included
hip ankle and thoracic mobility core training achilles tendon
prevention exercises or exercises with elastic bands for the
shoulder stability.
polarization index was calculated to quantify the level of
polarization every week treff et al. 2019. tld dened as
the percentage of objective training load ecos that the
triathlete performs in zones 1 2 and 3 was also calculated
every week.
heat adaptation protocol
a heat adaptation protocol was carried out in order to minimize
the impact on performance of the adversely expected weather
conditions in tokyo high humidity and temperature. on the
one hand the triathlete performed a heat acclimation using the
passive method of sauna from week 18 to the begin of the rst
competitive period in alternate weeks. the sauna session was
performed at the end of the training day. the triathlete was
exposed for 2030 min to a sauna bath with a temperature of
7080c racinais et al. 2019. on the other hand the weather of
alicante was used to do the acclimatization from week 34 to the
olympic games. thus the triathlete was gradually exposed to
training at intensities close to the competition in the middle hours
of the day. these training sessions were performed with a
temperature from 25 to 32c and with a humidity from 70
to 80. a specic noninvasive sensor to assess core body
temperature core green teg switzerland was used in
this training sessions verdel et al. 2021. a special focus on
hydration was done during this period. thus recovery drinks
with sodium were used to compensate for the sweat losses while
maintaining the optimal requirements of carbohydrates and
protein to optimize recovery racinais et al. 2015a. finally
the triathlete spent 10 days in tokyo before the rst competition
performing several training sessions to maintain the heat
adaptation.

repetitions of 400 m in the same track 24  400. the rest
between repetitions was 20 seconds. the lactate was measured
every four repetitions. despite the fact that in the second training
session the triathlete performed four repetitions more a lower
lactate concentration is observed. in addition body core
temperature reached was lower in the second training session
from 37.4 to 38.3c compared to the rst from 37.5 to 38.9c.

the olympic distance races. it is shown the average power the
average normalized power and the number of high intensity
power peaks from 550 to 1050 w. the average time of these
power peaks was 4.2 s.
discussion
the main goal of this research was to describe the training process
of a worldclass triathlete to prepare the tokyo olympic games.
the average of training volume carried out by the triathlete was
less than 15 h and the peak of training volume was almost 19 h.
this training volume is less than the training volume reported by
a female elite triathlete more than 20 weekly average training
hours in her olympic preparation for london 2012 mujika
2014 but higher than the training volume reported by amateur
longdistance triathletes neal et al. 2011 muoz et al. 2014
estevelanao et al. 2017 sellesperez et al. 2019. it is important
to note that the training volume referred in our study is the active
time and it does not include pauses and the time of the strength
training. compared with other endurance sports rnnestad and
hansen 2018 reported around 12 h of average weekly training
for an elite cyclist. kenneally et al. 2021 reported around 9 h
140 km weekly of weekly training volume for a case of study of a
worldclass 5000 m athlete. as a consequence the triathlete
reported more total training volume weekly hours than in
other cases of study about endurance athletes of other sport
disciplines. despite the fact that the volume per discipline is less
than the specialists in each sport triathletes must develop the
performance of three sport modalities. therefore a greater
number of weekly training hours would be necessary.
there are not too many studies which have analyzed the
training
load

by
high

endurance
athletes. trimps training impulse have been a method to
report training load in different endurance sports such as
running estevelanao et al. 2007 stellingwerff 2012 muoz

et al. 2011. it has also been used occasionally in triathlon neal
et al. 2011. however this method does not differentiate between
sports disciplines with its consequent energy cost or muscle
damage cejuela and estevelanao 2011. it is also based on
the triphasic model of training zones skinner and mclellan
1980 not considering that the time to maintain the intensity of
the exercise decrease exponentially from the second ventilatory
threshold billat et al. 2012. thus the ecomethod seems to be
more specic to quantify the training load in triathlon cejuela
and estevelanao 2011. weekly average ecos completed by the
triathlete was 1186.26  320.86 ecos. these data were in line
with the ecos reported by elite international triathletes olaya
cuartero and cejuela 2021 but higher than those reported by
elite national triathletes saugy et al. 2016 amateur long
distance triathletes estevelanao et al. 2017 sellesperez
et al. 2019 or amateur marathon runners estevelanao
et al. 2017.
tid followed by this triathlete was mainly polarized. several
previous studies have shown the effectiveness of polarized tid in
elite endurance athletes billat et al. 2001 fiskerstrand and seiler
2004 stggl and sperlich 2014 2015. it is also observed a
pyramidal tid in the rst part of the season. some other
cases of study have found this tid organization over the
season involving an evolution from a more pyramidal tid
during the preparatory period to a more polarized tid during
the competitive period tjelta 2019 kenneally et al. 2021. both
tid models polarized and pyramidal present the emphasis in
zone 1 80 being the remaining 20 of training volume
distributed mainly in zone 3 in polarized tid or mainly in zone 2
in pyramidal tid stggl and sperlich 2015. there is no clear
consensus on which of these models has greater effects on
performance since few experimental studies have been carried
out in this regard. treff et al. 2017 did not report signicantly
table 3  change in physiological measures and performance during the season.

differences between polarized and pyramidal training groups in
elite rowers. furthermore sellesperez et al. 2019 observed how
both tid were effective to improve the performance in amateur
longdistance triathletes but no clear differences between groups
were found.
tld has not been analyzed in previous studies. in this sense
even though most of the training was performed in zone 1 the
triathlete completed several training weeks with more than 50
of training load in zone 3. therefore the analysis of training load
distribution could be a new variable to be incorporated in future
research since it can provide more information about the
intensity performed by endurance athletes. a ratio of 50 of
training load in zone 1 and 50 in zones two and three could
represent a general guideline. besides the triathlete was exposed
to stressful training situations such as hypoxia and heat racinais
et al. 2015a flaherty et al. 2016. thus the weeks of training
camps in altitude and the training sessions to acclimation to the
tokyos weather represented an added stress that must be
considered.
the current consensus recommendations on training and
competing in the heat racinais et al. 2015a was followed to
design the heat adaptation protocol. heat acclimatization
improves thermal comfort and submaximal as well as maximal
exercise performance in warmhot conditions racinais et al.
2015b. the rst part of the acclimatization consisted on sauna
baths postexercise. previous studies have shown the effectiveness
of sauna bathing on heat acclimation kissling et al. 2020 kirby
et al. 2021. on the other hand 8 weeks of progressive heat
acclimatization in natural environment was performed by the
triathlete previous the week of competition in olympic games.
training sessions with heat progressed in intensity from low
intensity training sessions to simulated competition training
sessions during these weeks as well as the weather conditions
temperature and humidity were harder progressively. as it is
recommended in previous research the main acclimatization
block was performed the 2 weeks prior to travel with 10 days
of reacclimation after arrival to tokyo racinais et al. 2019.
training camps at high performance center in altitude had a
duration of 4 weeks. this period of time seems to be optimal to
inducing accelerated erythropoiesis whereas 18 days are long
enough for benecial changes in economy or muscle buffering
capacity millet et al. 2010. besides the altitude training camps
were developed at an altitude of 2340 m which is dened as the
optimal altitude to living high and training high 22002500
millet et al. 2010.
according to physiological measurements an improvement in
the triathletes performance is observed in the three disciplines.
relative peak vo2 value reported by the triathlete in the second
test was higher than the data reported about other elite endurance
athletes such as rowers treff et al. 2017 swimmers fernandes
et al. 2008 cyclists rnnestad and hansen 2018 or runners
balsalobrefernndez et al. 2018 and similar to other elite
triathletes millet et al. 2003. only some studies with topclass
endurance athletes have shown similar values of vo2max
rnnestad and hansen 2018 jones et al. 2021. the
improvement observed in peak vo2 was in line with the case
study reported by rnnestad and hansen 2018 where a world
class elite cyclist had an improvement of 17 after 58 training
weeks
using
a
block
periodization.
however
peak
vo2
improvements in both cycling and running are much higher
than other changes in vo2max reported in elite and welltrained
athletes after a training period garcapallars et al. 2010
storen et al. 2012 rnnestad et al. 2014. the triathlete
performed the rst test after transition period and after the
rst weeks of the season where the training sessions were
mainly at low intensity. so the detraining of high intensity
training
zones
should
be
considered
to
interpret
these
improvements. after the rst tests a greater amount of high
intensity training sessions were prescribed in the three disciplines
which had a greater impact on the triathletes peak vo2.
additionally the decrease in total body mass kg and fat
mass must be considered to read into the large change
observed in peak vo2 bassett and howley 2000 mooses and
hackney 2017 both absolute and relative mechanical peak

ventilatory thresholds during cycling test were similar than the
values reported for a worldclass cyclist rnnestad and hansen
2018. it is important to know that in the cycling segment of the
wts and og many high power peaks are demanded
conditioned by the orography and the tactics of the race.
finally the peak speed reported and ventilatory threshold
during running test were also in line with the data reported by
other elite running athletes ingham et al. 2012 kenneally et al.
2021 and with the performance obtained in the races.
finally some limitations should be considered. tests were
only performed at the beginning and in the middle of the season.
therefore the physiological changes produced from the middle
to the end of the season are not shown. the competitions as well
as the dynamics of specic training sessions for tokyo olympic
games did not allow a new test week to be scheduled at the end of
the macrocycle. in addition the manuscript shows a case study on
a training macrocycle of a worldclass triathlete so the training
program and the results obtained cannot be extrapolated to
another type of population.
despite these possible limitations this research may be
interesting for coaches and researches because helps to know
