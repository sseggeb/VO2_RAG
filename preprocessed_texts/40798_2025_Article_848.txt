abstract 
background  worldclass coaches collect training data from their athletes systematically and exhibit an experimental 
mindset when making individual training adjustments in response to this data and other forms of feedback. however 
the methods expertise and insights of highly accomplished endurance coaches is so far almost untouched in the sci
entific literature. the aim of this study was to provide a synthesis of common features and sportspecific variations 
in bestpractice training characteristics within olympic endurance sports as described by worldclass norwegian 
coaches.
methods  a multiple casestudy design was used and twelve successful male norwegian coaches served as key 
informants. together they were responsible for athletes winning more than 380 international medals representing 
longdistance running biathlon rowing crosscountry skiing speed skating road cycling swimming and triathlon. 
the study design included 1 an extensive emailadministered and wordbased questionnaire related to training 
characteristics at the macro meso micro and sessionlevel 2 crossreferencing data with historically reported 
training logs from successful athletes 3 indepth and semistructured inperson interviews with each coach 4 
a review process among authors and coaches. the data collection was undertaken in 2022.
results  all coaches adhere to a traditional periodization model including a gradual shift towards lower overall train
ing volume and more competitionspecific training as the competitive period approaches. the coaches also employ 
a pragmatic approach to align training organization with the various constraints faced in the training process. another 
common emerging feature was an emphasis on high volume of lowintensity training combined with 23 weekly 
key workout days consisting of 35 intensive training sessions. finally coaches across all sports focused on achieving 
high training quality by optimizing training sessions systematically controlling the loadrecovery balance and ensur
ing optimal preparations for major competitions. substantial sportspecific differences were evident in terms of vol
ume frequency intensity distribution and application of strength and cross training mainly due to variations in exer
cise mode constraints i.e. mechanical and muscular loading competition distance and organizational aspects.
conclusions  this study offers novel insights into bestpractice training characteristics in olympic endurance shed
ding light on both commonalities and sportspecific variations. these insights can be used to generate new hypoth
eses to be further elucidated and contribute to the development of evidencebased training practices.

background
performance development in endurance sports chal
lenges athletes to continuously strive to transcend their 
physical technical and psychological boundaries. this 
requires intricate harmonization of demanding sport
specific workouts with the imperative of recovery to 
optimize adaptations and minimize the risk of maladap
tation burnout and injury. longterm training strate
gies emerge from an interplay between evidencebased 
scientific knowledge and practical experience tailored 
to each sports unique demands shaped by physiologi
cal social and cultural influences. accordingly coaches 
must have a clear view of how they periodize and apply 
general training principles to achieve the highest possible 
quality in daytoday training practice 13. this frame
work forms the basis for the more detailed training load 
programming which builds on the coachs interpretation 
of a complex interplay of training duration intensity fre
quency methods e.g. intervals or continuous sessions 
and modality 13.
while training practices have been extensively quan
tified and described in worldclass athletes in long
distance running 411 road cycling 1219 and 
crosscountry skiing 2026 more limited information 
is available regarding training in other endurance disci
plines such as swimming biathlon speed skating row
ing and triathlon 2737. although traditional block 
and other periodization models have existed for decades 
2 3841 information regarding longterm training 
periodization in endurance sports remains scarce and 
equivocal. however independent of training organiza
tion some of the main characteristics of the training pro
cess observed among successful athletes seem common 
across endurance sports. this includes relatively high 
training volumes dedicating approximately 8090 of 
total training time to lowintensity endurance training 
lit supplemented by 1015 at moderate mit or 
highintensity hit and sportspecific variation in use 
of strength training technical drills and speed train
ing 4 1922 42. accepting these apparent universali
ties there are also significant sportspecific variations 
in competition duration exercise modalities and bio
mechanical constraints leading to different energetic 
mechanical and muscular loads across endurance sports 
43. this variation helps explain how sportspecific 
training regimes have emerged. to date valid compari
sons of training variables across studies and sports have 
been challenging due to the absence of a common meth
odological framework e.g. intensity zones and stand
ardized terminology.
the scientific understanding of the endurance training 
process remains incomplete and largely relies on small
sampled or case studies involving some of the worlds 
most prominent endurance athletes. these descrip
tive investigations primarily use retrospective training 
data extracted from athletes training diaries provid
ing important insights into individual training charac
teristics. however the methods expertise and insights 
of highly accomplished coaches have received minimal 
attention in endurance training research literature thus 
far. importantly these coaches are often connected to 
specific athletes for years or even their entire senior 
level career. this gap in information within the current 
literature highlights the need to gather complementary 
evidence from experienced coaches. in this context our 
experience is that the best coaches employ a systematic 
approach in collecting training data and exhibit an exper
imental mindset when making individual training adjust
ments that is almost untouched in the scientific literature 
44. in addition to possessing a clear mental model of 
how to organize and implement the training process suc
cessful coaches and athletes often emphasize indicators 
of training quality as crucial factors for achieving suc
cess 45 46. therefore elucidating and validating the 
longstanding wisdom of coaches who have achieved suc
cess with multiple athletes would provide novel insights

into bestpractice endurance training and generate new 
hypotheses to be tested in future experimental designs.
norway has emerged as a prominent sports nation 
47 in endurance sports. an additional advantage of the 
norwegian endurance training monitoring and testing 
system is the emergence and refinement of a uniform 
framework for defining training content across all endur
ance sports enabling valid comparisons across athletes 
and sports. based on the combination of questionnaires 
training data analyses and indepth semistructured 
interviews the purpose of this study was to explore com
mon features and sportspecific variations in bestprac
tice training characteristics in olympic endurance sports 
as described by worldclass norwegian coaches.
methods
study design
this study was a part of a larger project investigating 
successful coaches in olympic endurance sports. the 
present study focuses on their training practices at the 
annual monthly andor weekly level i.e. macro meso 
and microlevel respectively while training practices at 
the session level are presented in another study 48. we 
used a descriptive multiple case study design focused on 
the phenomenon of bestpractice training characteristics 
in olympic endurance sports. the cases of longdistance 
running biathlon rowing crosscountry skiing long
track speed skating road cycling swimming and tri
athlon are included in the current study. to exclude the 
possible influence of middledistance disciplines which 
are present in most of the abovelisted sports we only 
included endurance disciplines with  6  min competi
tion time. this corresponds to an aerobic energy contri
bution of  80 49. to allow for crosscomparisons and 
contrasts across sports all cases were situated in norway 
assuming relatively similar culture system and terminol
ogy to plan track and implement training. the data col
lection was undertaken in 2022.
this study was grounded in an interpretivist episte
mological perspective aiming to generate insights and 
understanding rather than to generalize findings. posi
tioned within the research paradigm of pragmatism our 
methodological approach provided both qualitative and 
quantitative data to illuminate the complexity and speci
ficity of the phenomenon under investigation. specifi
cally a combination of questionnaires training diaries 
and indepth semistructured interviews was used to col
lect revise and refine study outcomes through an inter
active process. the units of analysis were defined a priori 
based on the conceptual frameworks of training science 
50 training organization periodization and content at 
the macro meso and microlevel and training quality.
participants
twelve male norwegian coaches experienced with 
coaching of both female and male worldclass athletes 
participated in this project. they were all currently or 
previously responsible for the training of numerous 
worldclass mostly norwegian endurance athletes who 
in total have won nearly 400 olympic world and 
europeanchampionship medals. two coaches were 
engaged in each sport for distance crosscountry ski
ing biathlon swimming triathlon and longdistance 
running while one coach was engaged in each sport 
for speed skating rowing and road cycling. one coach 
was involved in both swimming and triathlon. writ
ten informed consent from all the coaches was obtained 
prior to the study and all coaches approved the manu
script prior to submission. the regional committee for 
medical and health research ethics waived the require
ment for ethical approval while the ethics of the pro
ject was performed in accordance with the institutional 
requirements at the school of health sciences kristiania 
university of applied sciences. the norwegian centre 
for research data approved data security and handling 
reference 605672 01.09.2023. the study was per
formed according to ethical standards outlined in the 
declaration of helsinki.
procedures
a pragmatic fourstep procedure was used to collect 
comprehensive and complementary information on 
training characteristics across different endurance sports
1	 initially a wordbased questionnaire related 
to training characteristics at the macro meso 
micro and sessionlevel was administered to all 
coaches by email. specifically the questionnaire
