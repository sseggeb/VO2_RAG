There is a growing interest in the scientiﬁc literature for reporting top-class endurance
athletes training programs. This case study reports on the training program of a world-
class male triathlete preparing to compete in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. A
macrocycle of 43 weeks is presented. The triathlete performed 14.74 ± 3.01 h of
weekly endurance training volume. Training intensity distribution (TID) was 81.93% ±
6.74%/7.16% ± 2.03%/10.91% ± 6.90% for zones 1 (low intensity, <VT1), 2 (moderate
intensity, VT1-VT2) and 3 (high intensity, >VT2) respectively. Pyramidal TID model is
observed during the initial stages of the periodization and Polarized TID model is observed
at the end of the macrocycle. The triathlete’s peak ˙VO2 was increased by 20% on cycling
and by 14% on running. Peak power was increased by 3.13% on cycling test and peak
speed by 9.71% on running test. Finally, the triathlete placed 12th in Olympic distance and
10th in Mixed Relay in Tokyo 2020 Olympic games.

INTRODUCTION
The summer Olympic Games are organized every 4 years with a great socioeconomic impact, since
they have an audience of more than three billion viewers around the world (Yan, 2020). Triathlon is
an endurance sport that combines swimming, road cycling and distance running performed in that
order (ITU, 2021). This sport has been part of the Olympic program since Sydney 2000 with the
Olympic distance discipline (1.5 km swimming, 40 km cycling and 10 km running). Tokyo 2020 has
been the ﬁrst edition to include the mixed relay format, where the four members of each participating team
(i.e, two women and two men) each complete a full super sprint distance triathlon (0.3 km swimming, 8 km
cycling and 2 km running). 55 triathletes participated in the Olympic distance of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic
Games, previously qualiﬁed according to different criteria 2 years before the event. A maximum of three
triathletes from the same country can take part in the individual event in both male and female categories.
Regarding to the mixed relay race, a total of 18 teams took part in the premiere of this modality in the
Olympic Games (ITU, 2021). Besides, Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games were considered particularly hard due to
the extreme weather conditions. Meteorological data indicated that weather condition were both hot
(26–28°C) and humid (87–89%) during the triathlon races. Such conditions affect the endurance
performance and increase the risk of exertional heat illness (Racinais et al., 2015a).
There is a growing interest in the scientiﬁc literature for reporting top-class endurance athletes’
successful programs (Ingham et al., 2012; Tnønessen et al., 2014; Rønnestad and Hansen, 2018; Tjelta,
2019; Haugen et al., 2021; Kenneally et al., 2021). Variables such as a total training volume, exercise
intensity and training intensity distribution (TID) have been commonly analyzed in this kind of
researches. TID is deﬁned as the time of the exercise that an athlete spends at the three different zones of

training intensity (Stöggl and Sperlich, 2014): zone 1, at or below
the ﬁrst ventilatory threshold (<VT1); zone 2, between ﬁrst and
second ventilatory threshold (VT1-VT2); zone 3, at or beyond the
second ventilatory threshold (>VT2) (Skinner and McLellan,
1980). Polarized model, which is based on a high percentage of
time at zone 1 and greater percentages at zone 3 than at zone 2, has
been presented as the optimal model of TID to enhance the
performance of endurance athletes (Seiler and Kjerland, 2006;
Neal et al., 2013; Stöggl and Sperlich, 2014). However, not all
ﬁndings on polarized TID point to its superiority (Treff et al.,
2017). Besides, other TID models as threshold or pyramidal, which
accumulate a greater percentage of time at zone 2 than polarized
model, has also been presented as effective (Plews and Laursen,
2017; Selles-Perez et al., 2019; González-Ravé et al., 2021). On the
other hand, fewer studies analyze training load using speciﬁc
training load quantiﬁcation methods for endurance sports
(Esteve-Lanao et al., 2017; Selles-Perez et al., 2019).
Physiological proﬁles of elite endurance athletes have been also
reported in several research (Ingham et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2017).
VO2max, ventilatory thresholds, as well as power or speed at which
these variables occur, these have been common parameters used by
coaches to assess ﬁtness levels and prescribe training plans. Even more,
it is particularly interesting to describe the dynamics of these variables
along the macrocycle (Legaz Arrese et al., 2005; Legaz and Eston, 2005;
Sellés-Pérez et al., 2019).
There are limited reports about training characteristics and
physiological performance of top-level triathletes (Millet and
Vleck, 2000; Millet et al., 2003). Mujika (2014) described
training characteristics of a female triathlete in her preparation
to the London 2012 Olympic Games. Later, this author presented
the physiological proﬁle and the training plan for a world-
champion male paratriathlete (Mujika et al., 2015). However, to
the best of our knowledge, no case report has been published of
world class male triathlete preparing for the Olympic Games. Thus,
the aim of this case study is to describe the training characteristics
and the physiological proﬁle of a world-class male triathlete who
participated in both the Olympic distance event and the mixed
relay event at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Characteristics of the Triathlete
This case study received the authorization from the Alicante
University Ethics Committee (UA-2017-04-11 expedient). Written
consent was obtained from a 29 years-old male triathlete who has
competed in world triathlon series since 2012 obtaining 20 podiums
and four victories in International Triathlon Union (ITU) races. He
ﬁnished in fourth position of the World Triathlon Series (WTS)
ranking in 2019, obtaining the qualiﬁcation for the Tokyo 2020
Olympic Games. He also competed in Rio 2016, where he placed 18th.
Physiological Testing, Anthropometric
Measures and Training Zone Settings
Swimming test were performed on a 25 m homologated
swimming
pool
through
an
incremental
multistage
test
consisting
of
seven
repetitions
of
200 m
every
5 min
(Sweetenham and Atkinson, 2003; Muñoz et al., 2014). The
ﬁrst repetition of the protocol was 20 s slower than his
personal best in 200 m registered the previous week in a
training session and then every repetition was 4 s faster until
the sixth, and for the seventh repetition the triathlete was told to
perform to swim as fast as possible. Blood lactate (bLA; mmol/l)
samples from the ear lobe were analyzed with a portable lactate
analyzer (Lactate Scout® 4, EKF Diagnostics, Germany). The
criteria to determine training zones were follows in swimming: a
blood lactate 0.5 mMol/L increase for ﬁrst lactate threshold (LT1),
>1 mmol/l increase for second lactate threshold (LT2) and
8–9 mmol/l for maximal aerobic speed (MAS) (Beneke, 2003;
Jamnick et al., 2020).
Incremental tests of volitional exhaustion were used to
determine training zones in cycling and running. A ramp
protocol was used for cycling on a roller (Cycleops® The
Hammer, United States) starting at 150 W and increasing 5 W
each 12 s (Muñoz et al., 2014). The triathlete used his own bike
(BH®, Aerolight, Spain) and his power meter (ROTOR®,
2inpower Road, Spain) to perform the test. The cycling tests
were performed in the same room with the same temperature
(20°C). The running test was performed on a 400 m homologated
track (University of Alicante facilities). The triathlete started at
13.9 km/h and increased 0.3 km/h every 200 m (Brue, 1985). The
triathlete uses the same running shoes in both test (ASICS®,
Metaspeed Edge, Japan). Weather conditions were a temperature
of 19°C and a wind of 7.5 km/h for the ﬁrst running test, while
they were a temperature of 15°C and a wind of 5.4 km/h for the
second test.
Running and cycling tests were conducted using a portable
gas-exchange analyzer (Cosmed® K4b 2, Italy). The following
variables were measured during the test: oxygen uptake ( ˙VO2);
pulmonary ventilation ( ˙VE); ventilatory equivalent for oxygen/
˙VE/ ˙VO2); ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide ( ˙VE/ ˙VCO2);
and end-tidal partial pressure of oxygen (PETO2) and carbon
dioxide (PETCO2). Maximal oxygen uptake (˙VO2max) was
recorded
as
the
highest
˙VO2
value
obtained
for
any
continuous 1 min period. The ﬁrst ventilatory threshold (VT1)
was determined using the criteria of an increase in both ˙VE/ ˙VO2
and PETO2 with no increase in ˙VE/ ˙VCO2, whereas the second
ventilatory threshold (VT2) was determined using the criteria of
an increase in both ˙VE/VO2 and ˙VE/ ˙VCO2 and a decrease in
PETCO2. Two independent observers identiﬁed VT1 and VT2.
Heart rate (HR) was continuously monitored during the test
using a heart rate meter (SUUNTO®, Spartan, Finland). Later, a
range of HR and power or velocity for each training zone was
established. Eight training zones were calculated to be more
precise prescribing the intensity of the training sessions. These
training zones reported both internal load (HR) and external load
(speed or power) data (Cejuela and Esteve-Lanao, 2011, 2020).
Besides, a RPE scale (1–10) was related to these training zones.
Additionally, the Skinner and McLellan triphasic model with
three training zones was followed to present TID and training
load distribution (TLD) data.
Anthropometric measurements were performed following
standard protocols adopted by the international society for the

Advancement on Kinanthropometry (ISAK) (Ross and Marfell-
Jones, 1991) by the same researcher with ISAK certiﬁcation level
3. All measurements were taken on the day of the cycling test
under basal conditions, in the same room with the same
temperature (22°C). Height and body mass were measured on
portable set scales (models 213 and 707, Seca®, Deutschland) to
the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.01 kg, respectively. The thickness of six
skinfolds (subscapular, triceps, supraspinale, abdominal, front
thigh and medial calf) were measured using a caliper calibrated to
the nearest 0.2 mm (Holtain®, United Kingdom). Four girths
(relaxed arm, ﬂexed arm, thigh and calf) were performed using
ﬂexible anthropometric steel tape (Holtain®, United Kingdom).
The sum of skinfolds was calculated, as well as muscular mass was
determined using the method of Lee et al. (2000).
Control of the Training Load
Cycling power data were measured using a power meter located
on the crank (ROTOR®, 2inpower Road, Spain). The triathlete
recorded all cycling and running training sessions with his HR
monitor (SUUNTO®, Spartan, Finland) and after the data were
uploaded
to
a
speciﬁc
data
analysis
software
(TrainingPeaks®,WKO5, United States). HR and RPE were
used mainly for low intensity workouts in running and
cycling. Speed and power were also used to control moderate
and high intensity workouts in running and cycling. RPE and the
medium pace for 100 m were used to control swimming
workouts, considering the different training zones obtained in
the swimming lactate test. Besides, the triathlete was ﬁlling
personal training logs with the information recorded regarding
the amount of time spent in each training zone and with other
subjective information such as hours of sleep and with the
subjective load scale (ECSs in Spanish) from 0 to 5 (Cejuela
and Esteve-Lanao, 2011; Cejuela and Esteve-Lanao, 2020).
Execution speed was controlled in strength training using a
linear encoder (VITRUVE®, Spain). Most of the training
workouts was supervised by the coach of the triathlete (RC) or
an assistant coach (SS or AT).
The objective load scale (ECOs in Spanish) training load
quantiﬁcation method was applied (Cejuela and Esteve-Lanao,
2011; Cejuela and Esteve-Lanao, 2020). Brieﬂy, the ECOs were
calculated by multiplying the time (minutes) that the triathlete
spends in every training zone (1–8) during the workout by a
scoring value between 1 and 50 (depending on the training zone)
and by a speciﬁc factor of 1.0, 0.75 or 0.5 for running, swimming or
cycling respectively. This methodology seems the most appropriate for
triathlon because it compares different endurance activities, attending
the different degrees of muscle damage, energy cost, effort densities,
and differences at the ability of maintaining technique in the three
segments (Cejuela and Esteve-Lanao, 2011; Cejuela and Esteve-Lanao,
2020). A speciﬁc software (All in your mind Training system®,
Mexico) was used to calculate the ECOs throughout the training plan.
Main Characteristics of the Training Period
The triathlete trained with the same methodology in the 2019 and
2020 seasons. The goal was competing in the WTS in 2019, where
he ranked fourth. Due to COVID-19 there were no WTS in 2020.
This season he was Spanish championship.
The training period for the Tokyo Olympic Games consisted
out of 43 weeks, which were grouped in a total of 14 mesocycles.
The main part of the training was developed in Alicante (Spain)
or in Talavera de la Reina (Spain). Besides, two training camps of
4 weeks were performed in the high-altitude performance center
of Sierra Nevada (2,340 m altitude, Spain). Simulated altitude
sessions (iAltitude®, Spain) were performed at three times of the
season (daily from week 8–10, from week 14–16 and from week
36–40). The duration of the sessions was from 45 to 90 min and
the range of altitude exposures was from 3,500 to 6,000 m. The
ﬁrst physiological tests took place at week 6 (swimming) and 7
(cycling and running test). The second physiological tests were
performed at week 24. A traditional periodization was used in the
ﬁrst part of the season. The general preparatory period was
performed from week 1–14. These weeks were characterized
by an increasing of training volume progressively, being the
most part of the training sessions around VT1. The speciﬁc
preparatory period was performed from week 15–30, including
the two training camps in high-altitude performance center. The
ﬁrst one was from week 18–21 and the second one was from week
27–30. The main goal of training period consisted in develop
higher training zones, nearer to race intensity (VO2max and VT2).
Usually, transitions trainings were performed twice weekly with
intensities nearer to the competition (around VT2). The triathlete
also took part in two competitions during this period in order to
training, one sprint duathlon at week 24 (1st) and one Olympic
triathlon at week 28 (1st). The ﬁrst competitive period lasted
5 weeks (from week 31 to week 35) and included two Olympic-
distance triathlon world series (WTS). The ﬁrst one in Yokohama
(week 32) where the triathlete ranked at 14th position and the
second one in Leeds (week 35) where the triathlete ranked at 4th
position. A Mixed relay Olympic qualiﬁcation event were also
performed at week 33 at Lisbon, where the team of Spain ranked
at 6th. A tapering period took place during this competitive
period. The aim goal of these weeks was reduced training load to
promote the supercompensation of the triathlete and improve the
recovery. This was mainly done through the training volume
reduction. High intensity training sessions were maintained
during this period. A 5 weeks training block (from week 36 to
week 40) of speciﬁc preparation to Tokyo Olympic Games was
conducted after these three competitions. Training load was
increased again during this period. Tapering period to the
Olympic games was performed during weeks 41 and 42,
through the decrease of the training load in an exponential
manner, in order to promote supercompensation. Besides,
these weeks included the adaptation period to the Tokyo jet
lag. Finally, the triathlete competed in both the Olympic distance
triathlon event and the mixed relay triathlon event at week 43.
The triathlete also performed strength training throughout his
preparation to the Olympic games. As a general rule, two weekly
strength training sessions were performed during the most part of
the season. Multi-joint exercises, both upper and lower body,
were performed by the triathlete. Training loads progressed from
55% to 75% of 1RM, performing from two to four sets per
exercise. The rep range was from four to eight reps per set,
always working away from muscle failure and with a loss of speed
not
greater
than
15%
within
the
set.

complementary exercises were carried out three or 4 days a week,
after the swimming training sessions. These exercises included
hip, ankle and thoracic mobility, core training, Achilles tendon
prevention exercises or exercises with elastic bands for the
shoulder stability.
Polarization index was calculated to quantify the level of
polarization every week (Treff et al., 2019). TLD, deﬁned as
the percentage of objective training load (ECOs) that the
triathlete performs in zones 1, 2 and 3, was also calculated
every week.
Heat Adaptation Protocol
A heat adaptation protocol was carried out in order to minimize
the impact on performance of the adversely expected weather
conditions in Tokyo (high humidity and temperature). On the
one hand, the triathlete performed a heat acclimation using the
passive method of sauna from week 18 to the begin of the ﬁrst
competitive period in alternate weeks. The sauna session was
performed at the end of the training day. The triathlete was
exposed for 20–30 min to a sauna bath with a temperature of
70–80°C (Racinais et al., 2019). On the other hand, the weather of
Alicante was used to do the acclimatization from week 34 to the
Olympic Games. Thus, the triathlete was gradually exposed to
training at intensities close to the competition in the middle hours
of the day. These training sessions were performed with a
temperature from 25 to 32°C and with a humidity from 70%
to 80%. A speciﬁc non-invasive sensor to assess core body
temperature (CORE®, green TEG, Switzerland) was used in
this training sessions (Verdel et al., 2021). A special focus on
hydration was done during this period. Thus, recovery drinks
with sodium were used to compensate for the sweat losses, while
maintaining the optimal requirements of carbohydrates and
protein to optimize recovery (Racinais et al., 2015a). Finally,
the triathlete spent 10 days in Tokyo before the ﬁrst competition
performing several training sessions to maintain the heat
adaptation.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the weekly subjective training load (ECS)
reported by the triathlete and
its relationship
with the
objective training load (ECOs). Peak of objective training load
was performed at week 37 (1757 ECOs). Training load of the
competitions was included in the summary. Peak of subjective
training load was reported at week 39 (ECS), 1 month before to
Tokyo Olympic Games. This subjective training load is related to
one of the weeks with more objective training load (week 39, 1517
ECOs).
Figure 2 shows the weekly training load (ECOs) for swim, bike
and run respectively. It is observed the peak training load for
swimming at week 15 (579 ECOs), for cycling at week 37 (896
ECOs) and for running at week 34 (766 ECOs).
Training
intensity
distribution,
training
volume,
and
polarization index of the weeks are presented in Table 1. After
4 weeks of low intensity training (>90% of training volume in
zone 1) a pyramidal model is shown from week ﬁve to week 18,
with the exception of week 12 (polarization index = 2.2). From 19
until the end of the training period a polarized training intensity
distribution were carried out by the triathlete the majority of the
weeks. Figure 3 shows the training load distribution. It is
observed that 50.6% ± 15.5% of the training load was
performed at zone 1 and 40.7% ± 16.8% was performed at zone 3.
Anthropometric measurements are presented at Table 2. A
decrease in total body mass and sum of skinfolds are shown.
However, few losses in muscular mass are reported. The change
in physiological measures and performance during the season is
observed at Table 3. The performance of the athlete was increased
considerably in the three segments.
Lactate blood concentration during two running training
sessions in heat condition is presented in Figure 4. Training
session 1 (week 36, 31°C and 68% of humidity) consisted in
twenty repetitions of 400 m in a track (20 × 400). Training session
2 (week 40, 27°C and 74% of humidity) consisted in twenty-four
repetitions of 400 m in the same track (24 × 400). The rest
between repetitions was 20 seconds. The lactate was measured
every four repetitions. Despite the fact that in the second training
session the triathlete performed four repetitions more, a lower
lactate concentration is observed. In addition, body core
temperature reached was lower in the second training session
(from 37.4 to 38.3°C) compared to the ﬁrst (from 37.5 to 38.9°C).
The performance in the races of the 2021 season is shown in
Table 4. Table 5 shows the power data of cycling segment during

the Olympic distance races. It is shown the average power, the
average normalized power and the number of high intensity
power peaks (from 550 to 1,050 W). The average time of these
power peaks was 4.2 s.
DISCUSSION
The main goal of this research was to describe the training process
of a world-class triathlete to prepare the Tokyo Olympic Games.
The average of training volume carried out by the triathlete was
less than 15 h, and the peak of training volume was almost 19 h.
This training volume is less than the training volume reported by
a female elite triathlete (more than 20 weekly average training
hours) in her Olympic preparation for London 2012 (Mujika,
2014), but higher than the training volume reported by amateur
long-distance triathletes (Neal et al., 2011; Muñoz et al., 2014;
Esteve-Lanao et al., 2017; Selles-Perez et al., 2019). It is important
to note that the training volume referred in our study is the active
time and it does not include pauses and the time of the strength
training. Compared with other endurance sports, Rønnestad and
Hansen (2018) reported around 12 h of average weekly training
for an elite cyclist. Kenneally et al. (2021) reported around 9 h
(140 km weekly) of weekly training volume for a case of study of a
world-class 5000 m athlete. As a consequence, the triathlete
reported more total training volume (weekly hours) than in
other cases of study about endurance athletes of other sport
disciplines. Despite the fact that the volume per discipline is less
than the specialists in each sport, triathletes must develop the
performance of three sport modalities. Therefore, a greater
number of weekly training hours would be necessary.
There are not too many studies which have analyzed the
training
load
developed
by
high
performance
endurance
athletes. TRIMPS (training impulse) have been a method to
report training load in different endurance sports such as
running (Esteve-Lanao et al., 2007; Stellingwerff, 2012; Muñoz
et al., 2013) or cycling (Earnest et al., 2004; Rodríguez-Marroyo

et al., 2011). It has also been used occasionally in triathlon (Neal
et al., 2011). However, this method does not differentiate between
sports disciplines with its consequent energy cost or muscle
damage (Cejuela and Esteve-Lanao, 2011). It is also based on
the triphasic model of training zones (Skinner and McLellan,
1980), not considering that the time to maintain the intensity of
the exercise decrease exponentially from the second ventilatory
threshold (Billat et al., 2012). Thus, the ECO-method seems to be
more speciﬁc to quantify the training load in triathlon (Cejuela
and Esteve-Lanao, 2011). Weekly average ECOs completed by the
triathlete was 1,186.26 ± 320.86 ECOs. These data were in line
with the ECOs reported by elite international triathletes (Olaya-
Cuartero and Cejuela, 2021), but higher than those reported by
elite national triathletes (Saugy et al., 2016), amateur long-
distance triathletes (Esteve-Lanao et al., 2017; Selles-Perez
et al., 2019) or amateur marathon runners (Esteve-Lanao
et al., 2017).
TID followed by this triathlete was mainly polarized. Several
previous studies have shown the effectiveness of polarized TID in
elite endurance athletes (Billat et al., 2001; Fiskerstrand and Seiler,
2004; Stöggl and Sperlich, 2014, 2015). It is also observed a
pyramidal TID in the ﬁrst part of the season. Some other
cases of study have found this TID organization over the
season, involving an evolution from a more pyramidal TID
during the preparatory period to a more polarized TID during
the competitive period (Tjelta, 2019; Kenneally et al., 2021). Both
TID models (polarized and pyramidal), present the emphasis in
zone 1 (≈80%), being the remaining ≈20% of training volume
distributed mainly in zone 3 in polarized TID or mainly in zone 2
in pyramidal TID (Stöggl and Sperlich, 2015). There is no clear
consensus on which of these models has greater effects on
performance, since few experimental studies have been carried
out in this regard. Treff et al. (2017) did not report signiﬁcantly

differences between polarized and pyramidal training groups in
elite rowers. Furthermore, Selles-Perez et al. (2019) observed how
both TID were effective to improve the performance in amateur
long-distance triathletes, but no clear differences between groups
were found.
TLD has not been analyzed in previous studies. In this sense,
even though most of the training was performed in zone 1, the
triathlete completed several training weeks with more than 50%
of training load in zone 3. Therefore, the analysis of training load
distribution could be a new variable to be incorporated in future
research, since it can provide more information about the
intensity performed by endurance athletes. A ratio of 50% of
training load in Zone 1 and 50% in zones two and three could
represent a general guideline. Besides, the triathlete was exposed
to stressful training situations such as hypoxia and heat (Racinais
et al., 2015a; Flaherty et al., 2016). Thus, the weeks of training
camps in altitude and the training sessions to acclimation to the
Tokyo’s weather represented an added stress that must be
considered.
The current consensus recommendations on training and
competing in the heat (Racinais et al., 2015a) was followed to
design the heat adaptation protocol. Heat acclimatization
improves thermal comfort and submaximal as well as maximal
exercise performance in warm-hot conditions (Racinais et al.,
2015b). The ﬁrst part of the acclimatization consisted on sauna
baths post-exercise. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness
of sauna bathing on heat acclimation (Kissling et al., 2020; Kirby
et al., 2021). On the other hand, 8 weeks of progressive heat
acclimatization in natural environment was performed by the
triathlete previous the week of competition in Olympic Games.
Training sessions with heat progressed in intensity (from low
intensity training sessions to simulated competition training
sessions) during these weeks, as well as the weather conditions
(temperature and humidity) were harder progressively. As it is
recommended in previous research, the main acclimatization
block was performed the 2 weeks prior to travel, with 10 days
of re-acclimation after arrival to Tokyo (Racinais et al., 2019).
Training camps at high performance center in altitude had a
duration of 4 weeks. This period of time seems to be optimal to
inducing accelerated erythropoiesis whereas 18 days are long
enough for beneﬁcial changes in economy or muscle buffering
capacity (Millet et al., 2010). Besides, the altitude training camps
were developed at an altitude of 2340 m which is deﬁned as the
optimal altitude to living high and training high (2,200–2,500)
(Millet et al., 2010).
According to physiological measurements, an improvement in
the triathlete’s performance is observed in the three disciplines.
Relative peak ˙VO2 value reported by the triathlete in the second
test was higher than the data reported about other elite endurance
athletes such as rowers (Treff et al., 2017), swimmers (Fernandes
et al., 2008), cyclists (Rønnestad and Hansen, 2018) or runners
(Balsalobre-Fernández et al., 2018), and similar to other elite
triathletes (Millet et al., 2003). Only some studies with top-class
endurance athletes have shown similar values of VO2max
(Rønnestad and Hansen, 2018; Jones et al., 2021). The
improvement observed in peak ˙VO2 was in line with the case
study reported by Rønnestad and Hansen (2018), where a world-
class elite cyclist had an improvement of 17% after 58 training
weeks
using
a
block
periodization.
However,
peak
˙VO2
improvements in both cycling and running are much higher
than other changes in ˙VO2max reported in elite and well-trained
athletes after a training period (García-Pallarés et al., 2010;
Stoøren et al., 2012; Rønnestad et al., 2014). The triathlete
performed the ﬁrst test after transition period and after the
ﬁrst weeks of the season, where the training sessions were
mainly at low intensity. So, the detraining of high intensity
training
zones
should
be
considered
to
interpret
these
improvements. After the ﬁrst tests, a greater amount of high
intensity training sessions were prescribed in the three disciplines,
which had a greater impact on the triathlete’s peak ˙VO2.
Additionally, the decrease in total body mass (kg) and fat
mass must be considered to read into the large change
observed in peak ˙VO2 (Bassett and Howley, 2000; Mooses and
Hackney, 2017) Both absolute and relative mechanical peak
power
output,
as
well
as
mechanical
power
output
at
ventilatory thresholds during cycling test were similar than the
values reported for a world-class cyclist (Rønnestad and Hansen,
2018). It is important to know that in the cycling segment of the
WTS and OG, many high power peaks are demanded,
conditioned by the orography and the tactics of the race.
Finally, the peak speed reported and ventilatory threshold
during running test were also in line with the data reported by
other elite running athletes (Ingham et al., 2012; Kenneally et al.,
2021) and with the performance obtained in the races.
Finally, some limitations should be considered. Tests were
only performed at the beginning and in the middle of the season.
Therefore, the physiological changes produced from the middle
to the end of the season are not shown. The competitions, as well
as the dynamics of speciﬁc training sessions for Tokyo Olympic
Games, did not allow a new test week to be scheduled at the end of
the macrocycle. In addition, the manuscript shows a case study on
a training macrocycle of a world-class triathlete, so the training
program and the results obtained cannot be extrapolated to
another type of population.
Despite these possible limitations, this research may be
interesting for coaches and researches because helps to know
