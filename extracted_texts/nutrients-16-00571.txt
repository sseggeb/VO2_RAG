Abstract: The dietary practices of athletes play a crucial role in shaping their body composition,
influencing sports performance, training adaptations, and overall health. However, despite the widely
acknowledged significance of dietary intake in athletic success, there exists a gap in our understanding
of the intricate relationships between nutrition, body composition, and performance. Furthermore,
emerging evidence suggests that many athletes fail to adopt optimal nutritional practices, which can
impede their potential achievements. In response, this Special Issue seeks to gather research papers
that delve into athletes’ dietary practices and their potential impacts on body composition and sports
performance. Additionally, studies focusing on interventions aimed at optimizing dietary habits are
encouraged. This paper outlines the key aspects and points that will be developed in the ensuing
articles of this Special Issue.
Keywords: athletes; dietary practices; body composition; sports performance; nutrition interventions;
training adaptations; optimal nutrition; athletic success
1. Introduction
The realm of sports performance represents a dynamic interplay of various factors,
among which dietary practices and body composition stand as pivotal elements [1]. In
this line, the importance of nutrition in sports is well established, with a growing body
of research underscoring its role in enhancing athletic performance, improving recovery,
and reducing the risk of injury and illness [2]. However, the one-size-fits-all approach is
rapidly becoming obsolete, as individualized nutrition strategies tailored to specific sports,
physiological demands, and personal health and fitness goals gain prominence [3].
Body composition, an athlete’s proportion of fat, muscle, and bone, is another critical
factor in sports performance [4]. The relationship between body composition and perfor-
mance is complex and sport specific [5]. For instance, while leaner body composition may
benefit endurance athletes, sports requiring explosive power or strength may necessitate a
higher muscle mass [6]. This Special Issue aims to dissect these relationships, providing
insights into how athletes can optimize their body composition for their specific sporting de-
mands. Furthermore, this Special Issue addresses the nutritional requirements for different

sports. The energy and nutrient needs of an athlete vary significantly across different sports
disciplines. Endurance sports, such as long-distance running, have different nutritional
demands compared to strength-based sports like weightlifting [2]. Understanding these
differences is crucial for developing effective dietary strategies that support the unique
needs of each athlete.
Evaluating the current dietary practices of athletes is a multifaceted endeavor that
extends beyond mere observation of food intake. It involves a deep dive into the intricacies
of athletes’ nutritional habits, encompassing the identification of common deficiencies or
excesses that could impact performance [7]. This comprehensive evaluation is crucial, as it
lays the groundwork for developing more effective and personalized nutritional strategies.
By understanding the real-world dietary patterns of athletes, including their specific nu-
tritional gaps and excesses, sports nutritionists and dietitians can tailor interventions that
address these unique needs [8]. This approach is not only about enhancing performance
but also about ensuring the overall health and well-being of the athlete. The complexity of
this task is compounded by the diverse range of sports, each with its specific nutritional
demands, making the role of individualized dietary assessment and planning even more
critical [9]. The factors influencing nutritional choices among athletes are as diverse as
the sports themselves. Personal preferences, cultural backgrounds, and the accessibility of
certain foods play significant roles in shaping an athlete’s diet [10]. Moreover, an athlete’s
knowledge about nutrition, or lack thereof, can greatly influence their food choices. This
Special Issue delves into these varied influences, providing a comprehensive overview
of how factors like cultural dietary norms, availability of food resources, personal taste
preferences, and nutritional education impact an athlete’s dietary decisions. Additionally,
the goals of the athlete, whether they are health-related or performance-oriented, also
steer their nutritional choices. Understanding these multifarious factors is essential for
developing effective nutritional strategies that are not only scientifically sound but also
culturally sensitive and personally appealing to athletes.
Nutrition’s role in training adaptations is a topic of paramount importance. The
appropriate balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronu-
trients (vitamins and minerals) is crucial for optimizing athletic performance [11]. This
balance influences various aspects of an athlete’s training, from enhancing endurance and
strength to promoting efficient muscle recovery and growth [11]. The latest research in
sports nutrition provides insights into how different dietary components can be optimized
to support specific training adaptations [12]. For instance, the role of carbohydrates in
energy provision and the importance of protein in muscle repair and growth are well
documented [13]. Additionally, this Special Issue explores how micronutrients and hy-
dration strategies contribute to reducing fatigue and enhancing overall training efficiency.
This comprehensive examination of nutrition’s role in training adaptations underscores
its significance in an athlete’s overall training regime. Optimal nutrition for recovery is
another critical aspect covered in this Special Issue. Recovery is not just a passive process
of rest but an active phase where nutrition plays a key role. The right nutritional strategies
during the recovery phase can significantly enhance the repair and rebuilding of muscle
tissues and replenish glycogen stores [14]. This section of this Special Issue delves into the
roles of various nutrients, such as proteins for muscle repair, carbohydrates for glycogen
replenishment, and electrolytes for fluid balance, in the recovery process. Understanding
these nutritional needs is crucial for developing effective recovery strategies that help
athletes return to training and competition more quickly and effectively [14].
The impact of dietary practices on an athlete’s long-term health is a topic that extends
beyond the realm of performance enhancement [15]. The long-term health implications
of an athlete’s diet are profound, with potential effects on cardiovascular health, bone
density, immune function, and overall well-being [16]. This Special Issue explores the
complex relationship between nutrition, health, and sports performance, emphasizing the
importance of a balanced diet not just for short-term gains in performance but also for
long-term health and quality of life. Interventions to improve dietary practices among

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571

athletes are essential for optimizing both performance and health outcomes. This Special
Issue discusses various strategies to enhance athletes’ dietary habits, including educational
programs to increase nutritional knowledge, personalized nutrition planning to cater to
individual needs, and the use of technology for monitoring and improving dietary habits.
These interventions are designed to empower athletes with the knowledge and tools they
need to make informed dietary choices that support their performance and health goals.
Then, this narrative review offers a comprehensive exploration of the complex inter-
play between dietary practices, body composition, and sports performance (Figure 1). It
provides a blend of theoretical insights, practical strategies, and future perspectives, aiming
to inform and inspire athletes, coaches, nutritionists, and researchers in the field of sports
nutrition. This Special Issue underscores the multifaceted nature of sports nutrition, high-
lighting its critical role in enhancing athletic performance, supporting training adaptations,
aiding recovery, and promoting long-term health.

dietary practices, body composition, and sports performance.
Thus, we employed a thorough approach to gather pertinent literature, aligning
with methodologies used by previous researchers in the field. Our comprehensive search
strategy encompassed not only traditional academic databases but also extended to grey
literature and consultations with subject matter experts. Key databases such as PubMed,
Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, Sports Discuss, ResearchGate, and the Web of Science
were utilized, alongside platforms like Google Scholar, to access a wider range of materials,
including those not peer reviewed.

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571

Our literature search was meticulously structured, employing keywords in line with
MeSH standards such as “dietary practices”, “body composition”, “sports performance”,
“athletic nutrition”, “performance-enhancing diets”, “sports-specific nutrition”, “nutritional
deficiencies in athletes”, and “dietary interventions in sports”. This strategy was designed
to comprehensively cover publications from 1 December 2013 to 15 December 2023 that
are pertinent to the focus of our review. A team of seven seasoned authors was involved
in screening the titles and abstracts of all gathered manuscripts. We established inclusion
criteria centered on the relevance to the review’s theme, scientific integrity, and alignment
with the subject of athletic performance and nutrition. Manuscripts that fell outside our
specified timeline, were not in English, or were irrelevant to our focused area of research
were excluded. This rigorous selection process was crucial in ensuring that only high-
quality and relevant studies were included in our review. The same team was responsible
for the critical task of data extraction and synthesis from the chosen studies. Each study
was independently reviewed, and its findings were integrated into a coherent narrative.
This approach allowed us to offer a comprehensive and systematic overview of the current
understanding in the field, presenting a nuanced and in-depth perspective on the complex
interplay between dietary practices, body composition, and sports performance, and
exploring the implications for athlete health and performance optimization.
2. Body Composition and Performance Relationships
Understanding the relationship between body composition and performance across
various sports disciplines is a complex yet crucial aspect of sports science. In aerobic
sports such as long-distance running and cycling, a leaner body composition is often
advantageous for efficiency and endurance. Knechtle, Wirth, and Knechtle (2010) found
a significant correlation between lower body fat percentage and higher performance in
endurance runners, emphasizing the importance of lean mass in endurance-based activi-
ties [17]. Similarly, Legaz and Eston (2005) demonstrated that triathletes with lower body
fat percentages exhibited better race times, particularly in running segments [18]. In the
context of long-distance running, the role of body composition extends beyond mere fat
percentage. A study by Beattie, Kenny, Lyons, and Carson (2014) explored the impact
of skeletal muscle mass on endurance performance [19]. They found that higher skeletal
muscle mass, particularly in the lower body, was associated with improved running ef-
ficiency and performance. [19] This suggests that while lower body fat is advantageous,
maintaining adequate muscle mass is also crucial for endurance athletes. Moreover, the
distribution of body fat plays a role in endurance sports. A study by Knechtle, Wirth,
and Knechtle (2010) also noted that not just the quantity, but the distribution of adipose
tissue, impacts endurance performance [17]. Athletes with lower central body fat—or fat
stored around the abdomen—tended to perform better in endurance events, indicating the
importance of body fat distribution in addition to overall body fat percentage [17].
In cycling, where both endurance and power are essential, body composition signifi-
cantly influences performance. A study by Menaspà, Quod, Martin, Peiffer, and Abbiss
(2015) highlighted that a lower body fat percentage and higher lean body mass were in-
dicative of higher power output in cyclists [20]. This underscores the need for a balanced
approach to body composition, where lean mass must be optimized alongside minimizing
excess body fat. Furthermore, the role of body composition in swimming, another aerobic
sport, has been explored by Sharp et al. (2017), who found that swimmers with lower
body fat percentages and higher lean body mass ratios exhibited better performance [21].
This aligns with the general trend in aerobic sports where efficiency, buoyancy, and power
are enhanced by optimal body composition. These studies collectively emphasize that in
aerobic sports, the goal of achieving a leaner body composition must be balanced with
maintaining sufficient muscle mass. This balance is crucial not only for performance en-
hancement but also for injury prevention and long-term athlete health. The challenge for
athletes and their support teams lies in crafting training and nutritional strategies that

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
5 of 32
support the development of an optimal body composition tailored to the specific demands
of their sport.
In anaerobic sports, where quick, explosive movements are essential, the importance
of muscle mass and power cannot be overstated. This is particularly evident in sports
like sprinting, where every millisecond counts, and high-intensity interval training, where
short bursts of maximum effort are required. The relationship between muscle mass and
sprint performance has been extensively studied. On this line, a research study by Seitz,
Reyes, Tran, Saez de Villarreal, and Haff (2014) found that increases in lower body strength
were significantly correlated with improvements in sprint performance [22]. This study
underscores the importance of developing lower body strength for athletes involved in
sprinting and similar high-intensity, short-duration sports.
Moreover, the type of muscle fibers plays a crucial role in anaerobic performance.
Fast-twitch muscle fibers, known for their quick response and high-power output, are
more prevalent in successful sprinters. A study by Egan and Zierath (2013) highlighted the
significance of these muscle fibers in anaerobic activities [23]. They noted that athletes with
a higher proportion of fast-twitch fibers tend to perform better in sports requiring short,
intense bursts of energy [23]. In addition to muscle mass and fiber type, muscle power is a
critical component of anaerobic performance. A study by Mero, Komi, and Gregor (1992)
demonstrated that muscle power, particularly during the initial phase of sprinting, signifi-
cantly influences overall sprint performance [24]. This finding suggests that training aimed
at increasing explosive power can be beneficial for athletes in anaerobic sports.
Furthermore, the role of body composition in high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
has been explored in recent research. A study by Boutcher (2011) found that HIIT can
lead to significant reductions in body fat, particularly visceral fat, while improving muscle
power and endurance [25]. This indicates that HIIT not only benefits athletes in terms
of performance but also positively impacts body composition. These studies collectively
highlight the multifaceted nature of body composition in anaerobic sports. While a higher
muscle mass is beneficial, the type of muscle fibers and the ability to generate power quickly
are equally important. Training programs for athletes in these sports need to focus not
just on increasing muscle size but also on enhancing muscle quality and power output.
This approach ensures that athletes can perform at their peak during the high-intensity
demands of their sports.
In sports demanding explosive strength, the composition and quality of muscle tissue
are paramount. A study by Comfort et al. (2012) demonstrated that in power athletes,
muscle hypertrophy, particularly in fast-twitch muscle fibers, is strongly correlated with
enhanced performance [26]. These fibers are known for their rapid force generation,
making them crucial in activities requiring sudden, intense bursts of power. Similarly,
Stone et al. (2003) found that muscle strength, particularly in the lower body, is a key pre-
dictor of sprint performance, highlighting the importance of muscle mass and strength in
sports requiring quick, powerful movements [27]. Furthermore, the role of body composi-
tion in explosive strength and power extends beyond muscle characteristics. Fat mass, or
the lack thereof, also plays a significant role. A lower body fat percentage can contribute
to a higher power-to-weight ratio, which is crucial in sports where body weight must be
propelled or moved rapidly. This was illustrated in a study by Zaras et al. (2013), which
found that lower body fat percentages were associated with improved performance in
weightlifting and jumping tasks [28].
3. Nutritional Requirements for Different Sports
In contemporary sports, an athlete’s preparation for competition is incomplete without
a diet tailored to their specific training needs. A diet providing adequate caloric intake,
inclusive of proteins, carbohydrates, and both micro and macronutrients, must align with
the unique demands of each sport. Factors such as the athlete’s position on the field,
the duration and type of sport, and adaptations to training dictate the energy system
utilized by the athlete. To avoid performance-related issues and recovery challenges due

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
6 of 32
to malnutrition and/or dehydration, as well as electrolyte imbalances, it is essential to
design a nutritional plan for each specific phase in an athlete’s career. This plan should
consider the varying requirements during competitive periods, training, or off-season,
each with its distinct characteristics [29]. Nutrition in sports is planned, personalized, and
periodized, aiming during training to promote recovery and adaptation, achieve optimal
body composition, and minimize injuries and illnesses, thereby enabling athletes to train
at the highest level. Therefore, the balance between carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and
micronutrients should facilitate metabolic adaptations relative to the athlete’s constitution
and training type [30]. Generally, athletes have a higher protein intake, essential for
repairing and promoting muscle tissue growth [31,32]. Moreover, optimizing training
and achieving peak competition results often involves the realm of supplementation.
While the market offers a vast array of products, only a few are backed by solid scientific
evidence [33,34]. Beyond these widespread practices among amateur and professional
athletes, evidence suggests that the role of a sports nutritionist is indispensable for both
performance and recovery, necessitating control over what, when, and how much to
eat, including which supplements and fluids to consume, not just from a performance
perspective but also for the athlete’s health [35].
Of course, nutritional requirements vary greatly depending on the physical activity. In
endurance sports, Vitale and Getzin (2019) emphasize the rise in popularity of this sports
category, leading to continuous revisions in sports nutrition and the supplementation
industry [36]. The perpetual quest for top performance leads elite athletes to embrace
new diets and/or supplements not yet supported by robust scientific evidence. The
consumption of carbohydrates is well established in endurance athletes’ diets, as is the
importance of total protein intake, particularly post exercise. Fat intake is increasingly
being emphasized, especially for ultra-endurance athletes. The mandatory intake of fluids
has been replaced with drinking according to thirst and sweat rates. Supplement use in
endurance sports is widespread. Caffeine is perhaps the most common ergogenic aid, albeit
with limitations due to side effects. Nitrates seem to enhance performance in non-elite
recreational athletes, potentially increasing time to exhaustion, improving cardiorespiratory
activity at the anaerobic threshold, and possibly VO2 max. Antioxidants might aid in
recovery, beneficial in multi-stage events. The evidence for probiotics is less substantial,
but urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal issues can be reduced with Lactobacillus
and Bifidobacteria [33].
In sprinting, nutrition may not play as crucial a role as in endurance sports. However,
the focus is on increasing muscle mass to generate more power. Here, again, protein intake is
essential, along with an adequate proportion of carbohydrates and fats to ensure sufficient
energy support [37]. Sprinters engage in intense activities lasting between 10 and 60 s,
usually with sufficient recovery time between competitions to avoid depleting muscular
energy stores. Nutritionally, the emphasis is on gastrointestinal well-being and avoiding
weight gain during competitions. Pre-race intake should include 1 to 2 g/kg of body mass
of carbohydrates 1 to 4 h before the event. Recovery should focus on easily digestible
proteins and carbohydrates, and antioxidant intake in solid and liquid forms. Ergogenic
aids in sprinting, such as bicarbonate or caffeine, must be thoroughly tested in training for
their buffering effects [38].
In strength and power sports, the focus is on the consumption of protein-rich foods
and essential amino acids in training, predominantly involving anaerobic muscle work [39].
Nutritional requirements in strength sports remain controversial due to their various sub-
types: strength–endurance, power (speed–strength), and maximal strength [40]. There is
a consensus on higher protein intake than recommended for strength or power athletes,
regardless of their training level [41]. Arciero et al. (2015) reiterated the necessity for perfor-
mance training to go hand-in-hand with sports nutrition [42]. Training for competition is
known to cause muscle damage, pain, and inflammation. Many athletes adopt flexibility
exercises and stretching to alleviate discomfort from exercise. Combining these restorative
exercises with the intake of specific nutrients with analgesic and/or anti-inflammatory prop-

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571

erties, such as ginger, turmeric, omega-3, or cherries, could be beneficial for athletes [43,44].
Although nutritional requirements vary based on the sport or the season, generally, steps
should be taken to prevent undesirable health consequences under the supervision of
specialists who also help athletes achieve peak performance. This involves prescribing the
intake of highly nutritious foods and appropriate ergogenic aids, and continually assessing
their effects on performance and health [43,44].
4. Optimizing Athlete Performance through Nutrition Insights
In recent times, there has been an increasing focus on the significance of adequate
nutrition in athletic achievement. Athletes need tailored dietary habits to bolster their
training, recuperation, and general well-being [45]. The nutritional state of athletes is
pivotal in maximizing their performance. According to multiple organizations, excellent
nutrition is essential for improving athletic performance and promoting post-exercise
recovery wellness [35]. Despite this, athletes in weight-category sports or aesthetic sports
often prioritize their weight and body image instead of a good quality nutrition plan [46].
Thus, this can impact their dietary preferences and lead them to adopt a specific nutrition
plan. Besides internal factors, athletes are also affected by external influences like media
and social pressures with regard to their nutrition choices [47,48].
Proper nutrition enables athletes to acquire the required fuel and essential nutrients
for their physical endeavors, support muscle development and repair, and uphold overall
health and wellness [35]. It is widely recognized that a well-rounded and healthy diet is
crucial for enhancing both health and performance in the realm of sports. Nutrition not only
influences physical abilities but also has an impact on athletes’ capacity to meet the specific
functional demands of their respective sports [45,46]. An important aspect of assessing
athletes’ present dietary habits involves evaluating their body composition [49], which
plays a critical role in sports performance by influencing strength, power, and agility [50].
Nevertheless, despite the known advantages of proper nutrition for athletes, research
indicates that many do not possess an adequate understanding regarding their distinct
nutritional requirements for optimal performance [51].
Athletes’ level of nutrition knowledge is an important factor to consider when as-
sessing dietary practices. Having a good understanding of nutrition is seen as crucial in
improving athletic performance, while insufficient knowledge can negatively affect both
the nutritional status and performance of athletes [52]. It is vital for athletes to grasp the
importance of what, when, and how they should consume food and drink before, during,
and after physical activity to enhance their performance and aid in optimal recovery [46].
Thus, numerous research studies have been carried out in the field of nutrition to explore
these issues and assess the existing dietary habits of athletes. In this line, a study conducted
by Cole et al. [53] explored the dietary practices of college football players and found that
a significant portion of athletes consumed insufficient energy intake for their physical
activity level and category. Similarly, Masoga et al. [54] reported that the dietary practices
of athletes involved in the sport of soccer did not adhere to soccer nutritional guidelines
established by the International Society of Sports Nutrition. Furthermore, Jusoh et al. [55]
did not observe significant differences in the knowledge and practice of nutrition between
sexes in handball. However, the results showed that nutrition knowledge had a significant
but weak positive correlation with eating habits among athletes.
The absence of adequate nutrition evaluation and assistance for athletes is a matter
of concern given the significant impact that nutrition professionals can have in enhancing
athletic performance and ensuring proper fulfillment of nutritional needs [56]. Adequate
nutrition is crucial not only for optimizing performance but also for minimizing the likeli-
hood of injuries and illnesses among athletes. Despite the advantages and significance of
appropriate nutrition for athletes, studies suggest that numerous athletes do not possess an
adequate understanding about their distinct nutritional needs for their specific sport [50].
Therefore, a lack of understanding can result in misguided dietary choices and nutritional
deficiencies. In general, assessing athletes’ current dietary habits involves examining how

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
8 of 32
nutritional knowledge is applied to develop a customized nutrition plan that aligns with
their physical activity, recovery needs, and overall well-being [57].
In conclusion, evaluating the current dietary practices of athletes is essential for
identifying areas of improvement and providing them with proper guidance [58]. Moreover,
evaluating athletes’ understanding of what and when they should be eating can help
practitioners and coaches better understand their nutritional needs and the level of support
required to optimize their performance [35,45,59].
5. Understanding the Dynamics of Nutritional Choices: Societal Influences
Nutrition-related decisions are crucial aspects of our daily routines, impacting bodily
functions, energy levels, and overall health [60]. Our dietary preferences are not random;
they are significantly influenced by our cultural background and societal structures, shaping
culinary choices [61]. Economic factors also play a role, affecting the diversity, quality, and
nutritional content of various dietary options [62]. Additionally, the evolving landscape of
advertising and social platforms goes beyond simple information sharing, actively molding
perceptions of appealing food choices [63]. Hence, nutritional decisions are interconnected
with society, culture, economics, and media influences. Understanding this intricate web is
vital for a comprehensive nutrition approach, enabling individuals to make well-informed
and health-conscious dietary choices [64].
Initially, it is important to acknowledge that eating has transformed into a social and
cultural event, expressing an individual’s and collective’s heritage and traditions [65]. Cul-
tures impart unique culinary traditions, offering a diverse range of ingredients, preparation
methods, and flavors [66]. Economic considerations become a powerful force, shaping the
nutritional landscape based on individuals’ socioeconomic status [67]. While those in a
better economic position enjoy diverse choices and nutrient-dense options, individuals with
lower socioeconomic status face constrained choices, often opting for more economically
feasible but less nutritious options, leading to health implications [68]. In the digital era, the
interaction between media and marketing significantly influences dietary choices, shaping
consumer preferences through social media narratives that extend beyond information dis-
semination [69]. This often directs consumers toward less nutritious options, perpetuating
a cycle where convenience overrides health [70]. Furthermore, psychological factors, in-
cluding emotional well-being, stress levels, and mental health, exert a significant impact on
nutritional choices [71]. Positive mental states often prompt healthier choices, while stress
may trigger cravings for less nutritious foods, revealing the complex interplay between
emotions and dietary habits [72]. Personal preferences also play a pivotal role in shaping
nutritional choices, as the spectrum of flavors and textures establishes the foundation for
dietary habits, creating a distinctive gastronomic identity [73]. Additionally, convenience
and accessibility are influential factors shaping the culinary choices of individuals in con-
temporary lifestyles [69]. In this context, easily obtainable food choices become a decisive
force as individuals seek quick solutions to satiate hunger amidst hectic schedules [61,74].
Balancing convenience and nutritional considerations emerge as a critical challenge, requir-
ing both individual awareness and societal initiatives that promote healthier convenience
options [75]. Moreover, education and knowledge emerge as a guiding mechanism for
individuals to make informed decisions. Access to accurate information enhances individu-
als’ ability to navigate the complexities of dietary information [76]. Informed individuals
comprehend the broader context of food, contributing not only to individual well-being but
also to the broader societal narrative around food, fostering a nutritionally literate society
that embraces sustainable and health-conscious dietary habits [77,78].
Furthermore, a portion of the population faces specific health conditions and indi-
vidualized constraints shaping nutritional choices. Allergies, intolerances, and unique
dietary restrictions become guiding forces, compelling individuals to navigate their culinary
choices with precision. These restrictions not only serve as pragmatic responses to health
concerns but also shape one’s identity and daily decision-making process. Driven by health
considerations, individuals find themselves compelled to choose foods that align with their

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
9 of 32
physiological needs, transcending taste preferences or convenience [61]. This personalized
approach to nutrition demands a heightened awareness of nutritional content, ingredi-
ent scrutiny, and alternative choices, requiring both individual agency and support from
healthcare professionals [79]. Despite presenting challenges, health conditions and dietary
restrictions open avenues for culinary creativity, transforming limitations into opportu-
nities for discovering new flavors and textures [80]. The fusion of health-driven choices
with culinary innovation not only meets nutritional needs but also enriches the culinary
experience for individuals navigating the intricate terrain of dietary restrictions [80].
Moreover, when considering athletes, nutritional choices become pivotal, influencing
factors from body composition to sports-specific capabilities, impacting performance and
well-being [2]. The interplay between dietary practices, body composition, and sports
performance is dynamic and multifaceted, shaped by various factors [58]. Athletes’ in-
dividualized needs, including age, gender, body composition, and metabolism, become
crucial considerations [81]. Recent advances in nutrigenomics provide personalized dietary
recommendations, unveiling how genetic makeup influences nutrient responses, allowing
for tailored dietary recommendations [82]. Training intensity and type significantly impact
energy expenditure and nutrient demands, with nutrient periodization allowing athletes
to tailor nutritional intake to different training phases [83]. This ensures the optimiza-
tion of energy levels, muscle recovery, and sustained peak performance throughout their
competitive season [84]. Further, environmental factors, such as altitude and extreme
temperatures, deeply influence athletes’ nutritional needs [85]. Strategic adjustments in
hydration, electrolyte balance, and nutrient intake become pivotal tools in adapting nutri-
tion [86]. Athletes, like those venturing into high altitudes, may require specific nutrient
interventions for enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, while those exposed to extreme heat
must navigate hydration strategies to prevent dehydration and heat-related issues [87].
Additionally, athletes often harbor specific body composition goals intricately linked to the
demands of their sport [58]. Advancements in body composition analysis technologies offer
accurate tools for monitoring and adjusting dietary practices with surgical precision [88].
Precision nutrition becomes a guiding principle, ensuring dietary choices are calibrated to
sculpt the optimal physique that complements the demands of their chosen discipline [89].
Furthermore, psychological, and emotional factors, including mental health and stress
levels, play a role in nutritional choices for athletes [90]. Social and cultural influences shape
dietary choices, and educational and access factors empower athletes to make informed
dietary decisions, enhancing overall performance and well-being [2,10].
Then, factors affecting nutritional choices are diverse and interconnected, and recent
advances in sports science and nutrition offer valuable insights for athletes to tailor their
dietary practices. Analyzing athletes’ unique needs, training regimen, environmental
conditions, psychological well-being, and cultural context holistically is essential. By
addressing these factors comprehensively, athletes can make informed nutritional choices
that contribute to their success and longevity in the competitive world of sports.
6. Optimizing Training with Nutritional Periodization in Sports: Adaptations
The adaptability to training is established through the interplay of training intensity,
volume, and frequency [91,92]. The interconnection between nutrition and exercise plays
a pivotal role in training adaptations. Indeed, dietary variations significantly influence
training adaptation. Numerous possibilities exist within periodized nutrition or nutritional
training, yet not all have equal scientific backing. Among the more accepted practices
are training with varying carbohydrate availability, supplement use, and enhancement of
intestinal function.
Athletes and trainers must remember that there are no miraculous methods, and that
nutritional periodization should aim for specific objectives. Combining different methods
can optimize nutritional training [79,84,93]. The goal of nutritional periodization is to en-
hance the body’s adaptation to training. Factors such as age, sex, physical condition, prior
nutritional state, diet, and specific training factors like intensity, volume, timing, and rest

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571

periods are pivotal in determining the efficacy of nutritional training in producing training
adaptations [94]. The vast diversity of athletic events, each with its unique bioenergetic,
biomechanical, and structural demands, requires a wide range of periodized nutrition com-
binations. Thus, nutritional training strategies for proteins, supplements, or carbohydrates
should be implemented and their complications observed [95]. For example, in protein
intake, considering the total amount, type, timing, and pattern of intake is crucial. Proper
application of these factors significantly impacts metabolic outcomes, thereby benefiting
the athlete with more favorable training adaptations [86,90].
This is evident in the plasticity of skeletal muscle, which can adapt its metabolism
based on the load and nutrient availability. Variability in macronutrient intake translates
into changes in substrate and hormone density in the blood available to muscle and insulin-
sensitive tissues. Consequently, the relationship between available substrates and exercise
will determine the capacity to inhibit or activate different biochemical pathways, potentially
impacting training adaptation [96].
In developing endurance, skeletal muscle exhibits training adaptations that are en-
hanced by nutritional periodization. It is posited that consuming fewer carbohydrates
during appropriately planned periods and increasing protein intake can foster greater
training adaptations [97]. Moreover, the adaptive response to endurance training can
be heightened by factors such as glycogen depletion, caloric restriction, oxidative stress,
among others. This increased stress at the molecular level elevates the quantity and activity
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), which
can subsequently induce primary adaptive responses to resistance exercise: mitochondrial
biogenesis, angiogenesis, and enhanced fat oxidation. Therefore, PGC-1α activation can be
regulated considering nutritional training [98].
Nikolaidis et al. (2018) indicate that ultra-endurance athletes generally share similar
habits with endurance athletes, except for a higher prevalence of vegan or vegetarian diets.
They exhibit similar training duration parameters to those of endurance athletes [99]. How-
ever, carbohydrate intake is higher in ultra-endurance athletes, with the quality of these
carbohydrates being crucial as it relates to higher exogenous carbohydrate oxidation and
mitigating common gastrointestinal discomforts in ultra-endurance events [99]. Further-
more, pre-competition nutritional training in ultra-endurance athletes should emphasize
fat utilization as fuel during exercise [99]. Thus, the nutritional adaptations to endurance
training are broad and varied. Each adaptation has its specifics within nutritional periodiza-
tion. Training at a moderate altitude (~1600–2400 m) presents a paradigm within endurance
training. However, there are risks associated with insufficient energy availability and the
need to facilitate higher iron intake in altitude training to avoid impeding adaptations.
Additionally, oxidative stress caused by altitude training should be mitigated through
antioxidant intake from foods, avoiding supplementation [86,100]. Therefore, combining
metabolism, cardiovascular system, and muscular adaptations with appropriate nutrition
and supplementation will result in enhanced performance for the endurance athlete [101].
Regarding high-intensity exercises, prevalent in many sports, supplementation be-
comes particularly interesting. The energy demand of anaerobic processes must be met to
satisfy adenosine triphosphate (ATP) requirements. The amount of ATP that can be gen-
erated is determined by muscular phosphocreatine (PCr) content, buffering capacity, and
the volume of contracting muscle mass. The latter two can be increased through anaerobic
training. However, PCr is unaffected by training. There is solid scientific evidence on the
benefits of dietary ergogenic aids like creatine and sodium bicarbonate or beta-alanine for
increasing anaerobic capacity [102]. Yet, results on the effects of nutritional supplements
are limited and sometimes perplexing. For instance, a study on five-day supplementation
with one of the most used aids, creatine monohydrate, did not increase anaerobic power in
trained wrestlers [103]. Sodium bicarbonate (0.3 g/kg of body mass) seems to be the most
effective ergogenic aid, but undesirable side effects like intestinal discomfort are associated
with such doses. Beta-alanine has been reported to cause paresthesia following a single

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
11 of 32
intake. Therefore, it may be more advisable to seek the combined ergogenic effects of
sodium bicarbonate and beta-alanine [104].
Despite the solid scientific backing for the co-ingestion of bicarbonate and beta-alanine,
as well as creatinine with beta-alanine, in improving performance in high-intensity exer-
cises, benefits might depend on the specific exercise and the athlete’s training state. Hence,
unraveling the workings of these synergies requires further research [105].
7. Optimal Nutrition for Recovery
Engaging in any form of physical activity results in an elevation in metabolism and
enhances the functioning of our body’s systems [106,107]. Athletes frequently employ
several recovery tactics (biological, pharmacological, mechanical, and dietary) to enhance
physiological responses and competitive performance to achieve optimal muscle recovery.
Bonilla et al. showed the identification of a 4R’s strategy to maximizing post-exercise
recovery based on a framework that relies on evidence. First, rehydration is a crucial process
that varies depending on the athlete, environment, and sporting event. Second, refueling
involves consuming carbohydrates, which not only replace glycogen reserves but also
provide energy for the immune system and tissue repair. Third, repair by consuming high-
quality protein and creatine monohydrate after exercising helps with the growth and repair
of tissues and rest—nutrition before sleep has a rejuvenating impact that aids in the recovery
of the musculoskeletal, endocrine, immunological, and nervous systems [31,41,108].
Focusing on nutrition, extensive research has been conducted on proteins, amino acids,
essential nutrients, and metabolic regulators (such as vitamins and minerals), which have
consistently shown their significance and efficacy in promoting muscle repair [106,107].
This additional preparation could significantly and lawfully assist athletes in effectively
supplementing their training to enhance their performance or attempt to expedite their
journey to the top of their sport. Thus, the food plan plays a crucial role in stimulating
muscle repair among the strategies applied. Thus, it is essential to optimize the intake
of appropriate quantities of energy, nutrients, and fluids while establishing the proper
frequency and timing about training and competition [84]. An expedited and more effective
recuperation will enable athletes to engage in more intense exercise and exhibit a more
favorable response to training, necessitating a sufficient nutritional intake [84]. Following
an examination of the ergogenic supplements and nutrients most frequently utilized by
athletes, this review will then concentrate our investigation on the supplementation utilized
during various types of physical training (Figure 2).
7.1. Ergogenic Supplement and Muscle Recovery
Athletes are advised to use certain nutritional supplements that have been proven to
enhance their workout performance. While some nutritional supplements may not directly
enhance performance, they can potentially enhance an athlete’s health, exercise adaptation,
and injury healing, hence aiding in more effective training and competition. The following
is a brief overview about dietary supplements that have the potential to enhance overall
health, facilitate exercise adaption, or expedite the recovery process.
Glutamine, along with other amino acids, promotes muscle growth by enhancing
protein synthesis [103]. According to Street et al. [104], the addition of glutamine to a
diet can reduce the intensity of the body’s inflammatory reaction following eccentric
activity. Legault et al. [105] discovered that the addition of glutamine lowers muscular
discomfort, suggesting a potential association with decreased muscle damage. More
specifically, Cordova-Martinez et al. also reported the impact of glutamine supplementation
on the recuperation process following eccentric muscle damage in elite basketball players.
The findings indicate that glutamine supplementation leads to a reduction in the levels of
muscle damage markers in the bloodstream [106–110]. This is accompanied by a proper
equilibrium between the response of the hormones responsible for breaking down muscle
tissue and those responsible for building it up, as well as the stability of the number of
white blood cells [104,111,112].

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
12 of 32
Regarding vitamin D, Mieszkowski et al. [113] examined the anti-inflammatory proper-
ties of vitamin D in the context of exercise training. In a previous study, Choi et al. reported
that vitamin D administration in an animal model greatly decreases inflammation caused
by high-intensity exercise [114]. However, a recent meta-analysis examined the impact of Vi-
tamin D on muscle recovery after exercise [115]. It was found that while Vitamin D appears
to be beneficial in reducing muscle inflammation, its role in promoting post-exercise recov-
ery by regulating the release of muscle biomarkers has yet to be proven [116]. Caballero-
García et al. recommend that future trials incorporate cytokine measurements and consider
variables such as extended administration duration or increased supplementing dosage.
Vitamin D supplementation is used to restore and optimize blood levels of vitamin D from
a practical standpoint. However, other studies employing similar techniques are required
to obtain more robust information regarding post-exercise muscle recovery [116].
Figure 2. Primary methods of recuperation following physical activity via dietary intake.
Creatine is extensively researched and widely used as an ergogenic supplement by
athletes and weightlifters who aim to enhance their performance, boost exercise training
effects, and reduce recuperation duration [117,118]. Research repeatedly demonstrates
that using creatine supplements has a beneficial impact on both individual and repeated
instances of brief, intense physical activities while also enhancing the body’s response to
exercise training. In addition, the use of creatine supplements can accelerate the recovery
time between periods of intense physical activity by reducing muscle damage and facil-
itating the faster restoration of lost muscle strength [119]. In fact, creatine monohydrate
has the potential to accelerate recovery and adaptation to hard exercise, as well as recovery
after periods of injury accompanied by prolonged inactivity. It may also improve cogni-

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
13 of 32
tive processing and aid in the reduction in severity or promotion of recovery from mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI) [119].
Citrulline malate (CM) has been found to enhance aerobic energy production and
increase phosphocreatine (PCr) levels during exercise recovery [120,121]. It also improves
ammonia (NH3) elimination after exhaustive exercise [122,123], reduces muscle soreness
following high-intensity resistance exercise (RE), and enhances performance in repeated
bouts of high-intensity RE [124]. Ultimately, da Silva and colleagues demonstrated that the
administration of CM at a dosage of 6 g taken 60 min before a workout does not enhance
the process of muscle recovery following a single session of high-intensity resistance
exercise in young adult men who are not trained in physical fitness. Consequently, it
may be too early to suggest the use of complimentary CM as a performance-enhancing
supplement to enhance muscle recovery following resistance exercise [125]. In fact, Gough
et al. warned that the absence of beneficial outcomes from CM supplementation in the
current body of research can be attributed to several factors. These include the testing
protocols not primarily emphasizing aerobic energy contribution, the lack of consistency in
exercise protocols for repeated testing, the strategy for administering CM (i.e., dosage and
timing), and the recent identification of quality control problems with certain manufacturers’
citrulline/malate ratios [126].
In order to achieve maximum muscle protein synthesis and net protein balance, it
is crucial to consume a source of protein after resistance exercise [127]. These factors are
necessary to sustain muscular hypertrophy throughout training. Recent studies indicate
that consuming a moderate amount (approximately 20–25 g) of quickly digested proteins
that are high in leucine can enhance muscle protein synthesis [128]. However, in this
regard, the recommendations for athletes to enhance muscle protein synthesis (MPS)
through protein intake per serving are varied and depend on factors such as age and
recent resistance training stimulus. It is generally recommended to consume 0.25 g of
high-quality protein per kilogram of body weight or a total amount of 20–40 g [129]. This
suggests that whey protein can be a beneficial supplement for individuals looking to
optimize their recovery and adaptation to resistance exercise. Consuming 25 g or more as
mentioned of whey protein following an evening session of resistance exercise showed a
tendency to enhance overall net protein balance in the body throughout a 10 h overnight
recovery period, compared to a control group that did not exercise [130]. Additionally, the
whey protein supplement was moderately more effective than a post-exercise supplement
containing the same number of calories from carbohydrates. Ingesting an extra 25 g
of whey protein in the morning following exercise resulted in a higher overall protein
balance in the body over the 24 h recovery period compared to a control group that did
not exercise and received carbohydrate supplementation. The addition of whey protein
was found to increase overall body anabolism, leading to improved recovery and exercise
performance following a strenuous resistance workout [130]. Regarding this matter, it has
been emphasized that the supplementation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) does
not seem to have a substantial effect on performance. Conversely, using isolated BCAAs
orally decreases muscular pain. BCAAs can be found in various supplemental products,
such as protein whey, and are frequently mixed with other nutrients, such as carbs. Hence,
it is necessary to exercise caution when interpreting the possible advantages of providing
athletes with isolated BCAA supplementation in order to reduce muscle soreness and
prolong endurance [131–133].
7.2. Endurance Training Recovery
Optimal recovery after endurance training is contingent upon maintaining proper
nutrition. The consumption of carbohydrates and proteins in one’s diet provides the
necessary components to improve the replenishment of glycogen and the restructuring of
skeletal muscle proteins. Both of these processes are crucial for quickly restoring muscular
function and performance. The consensus statement from the Academy of Nutrition
and Dietetics (AND), Dietitians of Canada (DC), and the American College of Sports

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
14 of 32
Medicine (ACSM) suggests that for moderate exercise (1 h per day), individuals should
consume 5–7 g of carbohydrates per kilogram of bodyweight per day (g/kg/day). For
moderate to high intensity exercise (1–3 h per day), the recommended intake increases
to 6–10 g/kg/day. Ultra-endurance athletes that have a very high degree of dedication
to daily physical activity (4–5 h of exercise at a moderate to high intensity per day) may
require a daily intake of 8–12 g per kilogram of body weight [29]. The International Society
of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) suggests that athletes should follow a high carbohydrate (CHO)
diet, consuming 8–12 g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight per day, in order to
optimize their glycogen level [134].
When the time available for recovery is limited (less than 8 h), consuming both carbo-
hydrates and proteins soon after exercise can work together to increase the replenishment
of glycogen and quickly accelerate the synthesis of muscle protein. However, it should be
noted that the ingestion of protein alone can also enhance muscle protein synthesis [135].
In fact, restoring depleted muscle glycogen is a crucial dietary objective, and consuming
carbohydrates after exercise remains a widely used and effective food timing strategy to
optimize glycogen restoration. In a groundbreaking study by Ivy and colleagues, it was
discovered that replenishing muscle glycogen was significantly faster and more thorough
when a carbohydrate bolus (2 g/kg of a 25% carbohydrate solution) was consumed within
30 min after a cycling exercise session (lasting 70 min at 68% VO2max, followed by six sets
of 2 min intervals at 88% VO2max). This was compared to waiting for two hours after
completing the exercise. The restoration of muscle glycogen was found to be 50% quicker
and more complete in the former scenario [136]. A recent study carried out by Viribay and
colleagues showed that consuming a high amount of carbohydrates (120 g/h) during a
mountain marathon may reduce the extent of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) as
measured by creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase (GOT), as well as the internal exercise load, compared to carbohydrate in-
take of 60 and 90 g/h [137]. The potential consequences of consuming a larger amount
of carbohydrates (120 g/h) compared to the recommended consumption (90 g/h) may
result in the development of a more effective approach to reduce exercise-induced muscle
damage (EIMD) in physically demanding endurance activities like mountain marathons
and ultra-endurance events [137]. In this regard, Loureiro et al. reported that consuming
coffee with sweetened milk enhanced the replenishment of muscle glycogen during the
4 h recovery period following intense cycling exercise in comparison to consuming sweet-
ened milk alone. Incorporating coffee into a post-exercise drink that contains sufficient
carbs is a successful tactic for enhancing the replenishment of muscle glycogen in cycling
competitors who have a limited recovery time (<4 h) or participate in contests involving
consecutive and repeated periods of activity [138]. The main type of carbohydrates that
are commonly consumed during and after exercise are glucose (polymers). Nevertheless,
the ability of the intestinal glucose transport system (SGLT1) may restrict the absorption of
glucose in the intestines [139]. Intestinal fructose uptake is primarily dependent on GLUT5
transporters rather than SGLT1 transporters, indicating that it is not regulated by the same
transport system. The simultaneous consumption of glucose and fructose can enhance
the overall availability of external carbohydrates, resulting in increased rates of external
carbohydrate oxidation. Consuming a combination of glucose and fructose can enhance
endurance exercise performance when compared to consuming an equivalent amount of
glucose alone [140,141]. The use of fructose along with other substances can speed up the
process of replenishing glycogen in the liver after exercise. This can be particularly useful
when a quick recovery is needed within a time frame of less than 24 h [142].
Historically, endurance athletes have assigned lower importance to protein relative
to glucose. Nevertheless, it is crucial for athletes, regardless of whether they are trained
in endurance or resistance, to consume enough protein and to do so at the appropriate
times. An obsolete model merely adheres to nitrogen balance, which was first devised to
avert nutrient insufficiency rather than maximize performance [31]. Athletes necessitate
elevated protein consumption above the existing Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
15 of 32
0.8 g/kg/day to attain training adaptations and enhance performance [31]. The American
Dietetic Association (AND), Dietitians of Canada (DC), and American College of Sports
Medicine (ACSM) all advocate for athletes to consume protein within the range of 1.2–2.0 g
per kilogram of body weight per day. Additionally, the International Society of Sports
Nutrition (ISSN) suggests a protein intake of 1.4–2.0 g per kilogram of body weight per
day [134,143]. However, Churchward-Venne et al. reported that protein consumed follow-
ing endurance exercise is effectively broken down and assimilated into the bloodstream.
These researchers pointed out that the overall balance of protein in the entire body and
the integration of amino acids from dietary protein into mitochondrial protein respond
to higher protein consumption in a manner that depends on the dosage. Concretely, con-
suming 30 g of protein is enough to optimize myofibrillar protein synthesis rates when
recovering from a single session of endurance exercise [144]. Also, Holwerda et al. added
that consuming at least 30 g of protein enhances the pace at which myofibrillar protein
synthesis occurs after exercise in older men [145]. However, as will be mentioned later, en-
hancing daily protein consumption to 1.5 g per kilogram by consuming either whey or soy
protein supplements alleviates the decline in field performance that occurs after consecutive
speed-endurance training sessions without impacting exercise-induced muscle damage
and indications of redox status [146]. Regarding the timing of intake, Trommelen et al.
recommended ingesting protein before sleep enhances the rates of protein synthesis in
both mitochondria and myofibrils during the overnight recovery period following exercise.
Their study specified that there is no difference in the muscle protein synthesis response
to whey and casein protein during the night [147]. However, in males who engage in
resistance training, the reduction in muscle performance decline and the drop in plasma
CK levels after consuming BCAAs supplements are probably insignificant when combined
with a diet containing around 1.2 g of protein per kilogram of body weight each day [148].
Regarding antioxidants, the post-exercise repair phase emphasizes the use of antiox-
idants and anti-inflammatory compounds. An elevated level of antioxidants results in
the mitigation of oxidative stress induced by the generation of reactive oxygen species
during the inflammatory process [149]. Consequently, the utilization of antioxidants can
diminish muscle soreness and aid in recovery in the immediate term. However, exces-
sive doses have also been associated with diminished training advantages in the long
run. Levers et al. (2016) discovered that a brief supplementation of 480 mg·day−1 of Mont-
morency powdered tart cherries, combined with a single session of resistance training, re-
sulted in notable improvements in serum markers related to muscle breakdown, physiologi-
cal stress, and inflammation [150]. Recent research has confirmed that consuming more than
1000 mg of polyphenols derived from fruits on a daily basis can improve muscle regenera-
tion after damage. This is achieved through the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects
of these compounds [151]. Additional herbal and mushroom supplements with potential
benefits for enhancing post-exercise recovery are Zingiber officinale [48], Zingiber officinale +
Bixa orellana L. [152], Rhodiola rosea [153]. Furthermore, the adaptogenic, anti-inflammatory,
and antioxidant characteristics of ashwagandha make it a promising approach for en-
hancing recovery and facilitating exercise-induced adaptations [154]. However, further
investigation is necessary, although the recommended dosages consist of 300 to 500 mg of
aqueous root extract taken twice daily.
7.3. Metabolic Conditioning and Strength Training Recovery
Optimal nutrition is essential for the post-exercise recuperation of well-trained athletes,
especially following metabolic conditioning or strength sessions. In this regard, prioritizing
the consumption of high-quality proteins is crucial for efficient muscle recovery [2,45,155].
Also, carbohydrates are crucial for refilling glycogen stores, and complex alternatives are
preferred [156]. Incorporating nutritious fats from sources such as avocados, almonds,
and olive oil enhances overall well-being and facilitates the process of recuperation [157].
Additionally, proper hydration is essential, necessitating the replenishment of lost fluids
through water or sports drinks in order to maximize performance and facilitate recovery.

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
16 of 32
Recognizing the importance of micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, in physio-
logical processes emphasizes the necessity of maintaining a well-balanced diet [158]. It is
necessary to mention that personalizing nutrition according to individual requirements is
crucial, emphasizing the significance of consulting a nutrition expert or sports dietitian for
customized advice in this vital component of athlete health [159]. For instance, the Mediter-
ranean diet (MD) is characterized by a substantial consumption of cereals, vegetables,
fruits, nuts, and olive oil. It involves a moderate intake of dairy products, primarily cheese,
fish, and poultry, while limiting the consumption of red and processed meats. Studies
reported that MD provides athletes with a sufficient supply of carbs, which are suitable for
enhancing recovery and optimizing the performance of CrossFit athletes, in addition to
bioactive ingredients [160].
Moreover, in a 12-week observational trial, Drobnic et al. [161] examined the impact
of krill oil on HS-Omega-3 index levels and plasma choline in relation to performance
and recovery following strenuous exercise. The study was centered on the restoration of
HS-Omega-3 index levels, the recuperation of plasma choline levels after exercise, and the
removal of free radicals following intense physical training. The researchers noted that the
simultaneous intake of n-3 PUFAs, choline, and astaxanthin in the form of krill oil did not
show a distinct enhancement in athletic performance. Nevertheless, the authors suggest
that optimizing the HS-Omega-3 index prior to training, as well as choline and oxidative
stress post-training, could be crucial for enhancing athlete performance and facilitating
recovery [161].
Additionally, beetroot juice has been studied for its potential in treating hypertension,
enhancing physical performance, and aiding in post-exercise recovery [162–164]. Research
has shown that consuming 250 mL of beetroot juice, three times, with two servings 24 h and
48 h after completing 100 drop jumps, reduced muscle soreness and decreased performance
decline in countermovement jumps caused by eccentric exercise. However, it did not
seem to have any impact on maximal isometric voluntary contractions, creatine kinase
levels, and certain inflammatory markers such as Interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-alpha), and Interleukin 8 (IL-8). Additionally, it seems that taking BCAA
as a supplement after intense exercise can create a hormonal milieu that helps decrease
strength loss, minimize muscle injury, and promote muscle growth [165]. Also, Correia and
colleagues showed that a single-dose of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate free acid (HMB-Fa),
generated from leucine, has been found to enhance the recovery of work capacity following
high-intensity exercise. Additionally, it may reduce indicators of muscle injury, enhance
immediate immunological and hormonal responses, and prevent the loss of lean body
mass in catabolic conditions [164,165]. However, according to the results of Tan et al.’s
investigation, it is not recommended to simultaneously consume beetroot and pomegranate
powder (POM) for the purpose of improving resistance performance. Additionally, the
ingestion of BR did not significantly boost performance in the resistance testing battery
used in their study [166,167].
Milioni et al. reported that supplementing with β-Alanine during a high-intensity
interval training program resulted in an improvement in repeated sprint performance.
The augmentation of muscle carnosine levels resulting from β-alanine supplementation
may have played a role in reducing central fatigue during repeated sprinting. In sum-
mary, incorporating β-alanine supplementation into one’s diet may serve as an effective
measure to mitigate fatigue [168]. Regarding sodium bicarbonate, Gough et al. showed
that incorporating NaHCO3 into the training regimen of high-intensity boxing athletes
can effectively enhance acid-base balance recovery and thus increase their performance in
boxing [67]. Nevertheless, Malta et al. explicitly stated in their study on cycling that while
the administration of NaHCO3 frequently caused alkalosis, which suggests the presence of
physiological conditions conducive to enhancing performance, it did not have any effect on
performance or markers of neuromuscular exhaustion [169]. On the other hand, effect size
estimations demonstrate that individuals showed improved performance when they were
advised about consuming an ergogenic supplement. These data indicate that the observed

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
17 of 32
performance-enhancing effect of NaHCO3 may be attributed, at least partially, to a placebo
effect [169].
Analogous to Bonilla’s four Rs at the beginning of this part, it has been stated that
having a balanced nutrition plays a significant role in athlete metabolic or strength training
recovery, focusing on quality proteins and complex carbohydrates [108]. Ensuring sufficient
hydration and intake of micronutrients is crucial, promoting the need for individualized
nutrition guidance. Athletes from numerous disciplines can reap the advantages of adopt-
ing the MD. Also, krill oil demonstrated potential for optimizing Omega-3 levels and
improving overall performance. Furthermore, beetroot juice, BCAA supplements, and
HMB-Fa exhibit promise in decreasing muscle pain and promoting muscular development
in various workout scenarios.
8. Impact of Dietary Practices on Health
Poor health is significantly influenced by an unhealthy food pattern. The global
production, distribution, and consumption of food account for around 25–30% of total
greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), while also affecting other areas of environmental
sustainability [69]. Modifying dietary patterns possesses the capacity to enhance public
health and contribute to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 2) [170]. In the same
context, an inadequate diet is the primary contributing factor to mortality and impairment
on a global scale. Hunger and malnutrition inflict significant hardship on underprivileged
groups worldwide. Concurrently, diet-related cardiometabolic disorders such as coronary
heart disease (CHD), stroke, type 2 diabetes, and obesity result in even greater global
health costs [171]. Diet-related risk factors also have an impact on other vascular disorders,
including peripheral artery disease, chronic renal disease, cognitive decline, heart failure,
and atrial fibrillation [172]. Between 2011 and 2030, chronic diseases will result in a total
economic loss of USD 17.3 trillion globally. This loss will be due to expenses related to
healthcare, decreased productivity, and capital that is lost. Given the significant health
and economic challenges they provide, diet-related disorders are currently one of the
most pressing concerns [173]. In this regard, over the past few years, there has been a
significant change in the eating habits of people worldwide. Simultaneously, the field
of nutrition research has made significant progress. In the past two decades, nutrition
science has undergone a significant transformation. It has moved away from historical
dietary recommendations that were primarily based on cross-national studies, short-term
experiments, and animal models. Instead, it now relies on more rigorous evidence from
well-designed metabolic studies, prospective cohorts, and randomized clinical trials [171].
Human nutrition relies on dietary proteins, which are essential. Aside from their role
in tissue development, they also impact body composition and control several metabolic
processes, as well as feelings of fullness and immune system function [174]. Consum-
ing vegetable protein sources is linked to superior health results, particularly in rela-
tion to the cardiovascular system, compared to the use of animal-based products [175].
Also, carbohydrate-rich foods are crucial for maintaining a healthy diet as they supply
the body with glucose, which is essential for supporting bodily functions and physical
activity [134–136,176]. The positive health effects of vegetable protein sources align with
their reduced environmental footprint, a crucial factor to be taken into account when for-
mulating an ideal diet. Undoubtedly, the well-being of the Earth is intricately connected to
the well-being of human beings [177]. In relation to this, prevention guidelines advocate
consuming diets that are abundant in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and lean
sources of protein, while minimizing or avoiding processed foods, trans-fats, and sugar
sweetened beverages. MD, DASH, and plant-based diets have all demonstrated varied
degrees of cardioprotective effects and are supported by professional healthcare associa-
tions [178]. In the same line, knowing that cancer is a prominent cause of death globally,
diet and nutrition have a substantial influence on the initiation and advancement of cancer.
In this regard, significant enhancements in reducing cancer development, maintaining a
state free of recurrence, and restraining tumor growth were observed in several forms of

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
18 of 32
cancer when following MD, Keto Diet, and plant-based diets (Figure 3) [179]. For instance,
greater adherence to the Western-based diet was found to be strongly correlated with an
elevated risk of breast cancer (p < 0.045). Conversely, the Mediterranean diet was found
to have a negative association with the occurrence of breast cancer in pre-menopausal
women [180].
Figure 3. Over the course of a lifetime, poor nutrition can have negative effects on human develop-
ment, including declining mental health and metabolic issues that can lead to cancer. On the other
hand, good nutrition can also help prevent these negative outcomes.
Regarding mental health, observational and intervention studies in nutritional psy-
chiatry have provided increasing data on the significance of one’s diet for mental health
outcomes throughout one’s life [181,182]. The correlation between nutrition and mental
health is reciprocal: the food we consume has an impact on our mental well-being, and
our mental well-being influences our dietary choices and consumption quality. In recent
decades, there has been a significant rise in the occurrence of mental health issues [82], such
as an increasing prevalence of depression, anxiety, cognitive impairments, and sleep diffi-
culties [183]. The role of the diet and its bioactive components in affecting the development
of certain diseases has been acknowledged as a modifiable risk factor [184,185]. According
to Hossain et al. (2020), there is mounting evidence that suggests specific eating habits
can improve brain health [186]. One such pattern is increasing the consumption of fruits,
vegetables, and seafood. According to Román et al. (2019), the MD diet has the potential to
prevent depression and maintain cognitive function [187]. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
seafood, and unsaturated fatty acids are usually more prominent on this diet, and moderate
alcohol consumption is encouraged on a regular basis. Breast cancer survivors report
reduced cancer-related fatigue if their food is of higher quality after diagnosis [188]. In this
regard, a new research study has shown links between nutrition, mental health, and cancer,
and it found that cancer patients with Mediterranean diet patterns had a lower incidence of
depression (Figure 3) [189]. Nevertheless, in order to provide treatment recommendations
based on these findings, more research is needed.
When considering the effects of eating habits on health, it is important to acknowledge
the environmental factors that arise throughout childhood and the behavioral patterns
instilled by our parents [190,191]. Dietary and exercise patterns are established in childhood
and tend to continue into adulthood. Consequently, it is crucial to develop healthy lifestyle
habits early on in order to promote long-term health and reduce the likelihood of chronic

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571

diseases associated with lifestyle choices. The concept of positive parental role modeling
suggests that parents have an influence on their child’s eating behavior [192]. This is because
children tend to adopt their parents’ food preferences and eating behavior, which, in turn,
affects their own dietary behavior and attitudes towards food. For instance, the parents’
attitudes towards healthy eating have been found to positively influence the children’s
micronutrient consumption, potentially even more than the parents’ knowledge of what
constitutes a healthy childhood [192]. In this regard, Mäkelä et al.’s study contributes to
existing knowledge by demonstrating that parents’ perspectives and behaviors about their
child’s nutrition and well-being are influenced by their level of health consciousness. The
findings also indicate that these factors may additionally impact the nutritional value of
the meals that parents offer to their children and the child’s body weight, which can be
linked to many long-term diseases [193].
9. Enhancing Dietary Habits: Effective Intervention Strategies
The profound significance of nourishment in an athlete’s life cannot be overstated,
acting as the foundation for performance, recovery, and overall health [2,14,84,108]. As
athletes continually challenge their physical limits, the intricate link between dietary
practices and athletic outcomes has taken center stage in sports science [194]. From the
meticulous crafting of personalized nutrition plans to educational initiatives, the integration
of cutting-edge technology, and psychological tactics, each intervention plays a pivotal role
in the comprehensive approach to optimizing athletes’ nutrition [195].
The evolution of athletes’ dietary approaches has witnessed a transformative shift
with the rise in personalized nutrition plans [196]. Acknowledging athletes as distinctive
individuals with unique body compositions, metabolic rates, and energy needs, recent
advances in nutrigenomics unveil the complex relationship between genetic makeup and
nutrient response [5,6,13]. Developed collaboratively by sports nutritionists and dietitians,
these plans extend beyond macronutrient considerations to cover micronutrient require-
ments, hydration strategies, and nutrient timing [108,197]. Aligned with factors such as age,
gender, training intensity, and individual performance objectives, personalized nutrition
plans not only address immediate performance goals but also advocate for long-term health
and well-being [198]. By combining scientific precision with personalized care, these plans
guide athletes toward a future where optimal performance and individual well-being con-
verge seamlessly [199]. Further, educational programs emerge as transformative measures
in optimizing athletes’ dietary practices, seamlessly integrated into training regimens [200].
These comprehensive programs empower athletes with knowledge on essential topics
such as macronutrient and micronutrient requirements, hydration strategies, and precise
nutrient timing in relation to training and competition schedules [201]. Going beyond
information dissemination, these initiatives promote nutritional literacy, transforming
athletes from passive recipients of dietary advice into active participants shaping their
nutrition [202]. Bridging the gap between theory and practice, athletes acquire practical
skills, from deciphering food labels to planning nutritionally balanced meals [203]. In
essence, educational programs represent a holistic approach that transcends the conven-
tional athlete–coach dynamic, creating a partnership where athletes become co-architects of
their nutritional strategies, catalyzing performance enhancement and fostering a broader
narrative of athletes taking charge of their health and performance journey [204].
Moreover, in the age of technological progress, athletes benefit from state-of-the-art
tools facilitating precise monitoring and optimization of dietary practices [205]. Advanced
body composition analysis technologies, including Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry
(DEXA) scans and bioelectrical impedance analysis, deliver accurate insights into an ath-
lete’s muscle mass, fat percentage, and overall body composition [206]. Empowering
athletes and their support teams to make real-time adjustments to dietary practices en-
sures dynamic alignment with specific performance and body composition goals [207].
Beyond immediate impacts on performance, these technological advancements contribute
to a proactive approach to well-being, enabling early identification of imbalances and

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571

facilitating pre-emptive adjustments to training regimens and nutritional strategies [208].
As these tools evolve, athletes navigate the intricate landscape of sports nutrition with
unprecedented precision, ushering in an era where data-driven dietary practices are inte-
gral to the holistic enhancement of athletic performance and overall well-being [33,45,87].
Furthermore, interventions focused on nutrient timing have gained prominence, recogniz-
ing the critical importance of when nutrients are consumed [208]. Nutrient periodization,
aligned with the diverse demands of different training phases and competition schedules,
empowers athletes to strategically adjust their nutrient intake for optimized performance
outcomes [95]. The triad of pre-, intra-, and post-exercise nutrition assumes pivotal signifi-
cance in nutrient timing strategies, tailoring nutrition to fuel physical exertion, maintain
energy levels, and initiate the recovery process [209]. Synchronizing dietary practices with
the ever-changing requirements of an athlete’s training and competition cycles ensures the
right nutrients are delivered at the right times, maximizing efficacy for both immediate
and long-term performance benefits [210]. Nutrient timing strategies contribute to fatigue
prevention, reduction in muscle damage, and enhancements in overall recovery, playing
a pivotal role in an athlete’s holistic approach to physical well-being [211]. In addition,
athletes, grappling with stress, performance anxiety, and emotional factors shaping their
eating habits, benefit from psychological strategies as effective interventions [195,212].
Mindfulness training, cognitive–behavioral interventions, and counselling emerge as indis-
pensable tools, fostering awareness of thoughts and emotions surrounding food, promoting
intentional and balanced eating habits, and targeting negative thought patterns for healthier
food choices [213]. Beyond mitigating detrimental eating patterns, these psychological
strategies empower athletes to navigate the complex relationship between mental states and
dietary choices, fostering a sustainable and health-conscious approach to nutrition [214].
Therefore, in the pursuit of athletic excellence, interventions to improve dietary prac-
tices stand as indispensable components of a holistic approach to sports performance.
Personalized nutrition plans, educational programs, technological advancements, nutrient
timing strategies, and psychological interventions collectively contribute to fostering a
culture of informed and health-conscious dietary choices among athletes. As the field
of sports science continues to evolve, these interventions serve as valuable tools in opti-
mizing nutrition, ensuring athletes are not only physically prepared but also nutritionally
equipped to excel in their chosen sports. Through a combination of science, education,
and individualized strategies, athletes can harness the power of nutrition to enhance their
performance, recovery, and overall well-being.
10. Case Studies of Successful Dietary Strategies of Elite Athletes
The adaptability to training is intricately linked with the interplay of training inten-
sity, volume, and frequency, as underscored by Mujika et al. (2014) [92]. This dynamic
interconnection between nutrition and exercise is critical in shaping training adaptations.
Notably, dietary variations exert a significant influence on training adaptation, highlighting
the diverse possibilities within periodized nutrition or nutritional training. However, it is
important to recognize that not all practices within this domain are equally substantiated
by scientific evidence. Acknowledged practices include training with varying carbohydrate
availability, supplement use, and enhancement of intestinal function.
Athletes and trainers should be mindful that there are no miraculous shortcuts in
nutritional periodization, which should be strategically targeted towards specific objectives.
Combining different methods can effectively optimize nutritional training, as suggested
by Jeukendrup (2017) [93]. The ultimate aim of nutritional periodization is to facilitate the
body’s adaptation to training, taking into consideration factors such as age, sex, physical
condition, prior nutritional state, diet, and specific training factors like intensity, volume,
timing, and rest periods. These elements are crucial in determining the effectiveness of
nutritional training in fostering training adaptations, according to Kerksick et al. (2017) [94].
Given the vast diversity of athletic events, each with unique bioenergetic, biomechani-
cal, and structural demands, a broad spectrum of periodized nutrition combinations is

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
21 of 32
required. Therefore, implementing nutritional training strategies for proteins, supplements,
or carbohydrates, and closely monitoring their outcomes is essential.
The plasticity of skeletal muscle is a key factor in how it adapts its metabolism to
different training loads and nutrient availabilities. The variability in macronutrient intake
leads to changes in the availability of substrates and hormones in the blood, which, in
turn, affects muscle and insulin-sensitive tissues. This interaction between the available
nutrients and physical exercise plays a critical role in determining the body’s ability to
activate or inhibit various biochemical pathways, thereby influencing the effectiveness of
training adaptations. This relationship is crucial in understanding how dietary choices
impact the physiological responses to training, as highlighted by Hawley et al. (2011) [96].
In the context of developing endurance, skeletal muscle demonstrates notable training
adaptations, which can be significantly enhanced through the application of nutritional
periodization. Specifically, adopting a strategy that involves consuming fewer carbohy-
drates during strategically planned periods, while increasing protein intake, is believed to
foster greater training adaptations, as illustrated by Close et al. (2016) [97]. Furthermore,
the response to endurance training can be amplified through various factors like glycogen
depletion, caloric restriction, and oxidative stress. These factors elevate the molecular
level stress, consequently increasing the quantity and activity of peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). This activation plays a pivotal role
in inducing primary adaptive responses to resistance exercise, such as mitochondrial bio-
genesis, angiogenesis, and enhanced fat oxidation, highlighting the importance of PGC-1α
in the overall training adaptation process. This suggests that the activation of PGC-1α can
be effectively modulated through targeted nutritional training strategies, as per Baar [98].
Ultra-endurance athletes, while sharing many training habits with traditional en-
durance athletes, tend to have a higher prevalence of vegan or vegetarian diets, as noted
by Nikolaidis et al. [99]. These athletes also have a higher carbohydrate intake, which
is crucial for exogenous carbohydrate oxidation and mitigating gastrointestinal discom-
fort during ultra-endurance events. In terms of pre-competition nutrition, there is an
emphasis on fat utilization as fuel during exercise. The nutritional adaptations required
for endurance training are diverse and specific to the type of training undertaken. For
instance, training at moderate altitudes (approximately 1600–2400 m) introduces unique
challenges, including the risks associated with insufficient energy availability and the
need for increased iron intake to avoid compromising training adaptations. Additionally,
oxidative stress from altitude training should be addressed through dietary antioxidants,
rather than supplementation, as suggested by Stellingwerff et al. [100]. Combining these
metabolic, cardiovascular, and muscular adaptations with appropriate nutrition and sup-
plementation is key to enhancing performance for endurance athletes, as highlighted by
Earnest et al. [101].
In the realm of high-intensity sports, the use of dietary supplements for enhancing
anaerobic performance garners considerable interest. The energy required for anaerobic
processes is fulfilled through adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with its production relying on
muscular phosphocreatine (PCr) content, buffering capacity, and the volume of contracting
muscle mass. While the latter two aspects can be augmented through anaerobic training,
PCr remains unaffected by such training. Significant scientific evidence supports the
benefits of dietary ergogenic aids like creatine, sodium bicarbonate, and beta-alanine in
augmenting anaerobic capacity, as noted by Sahlin [102]. However, the impact of these
supplements on athletic performance can be inconsistent. For instance, a study revealed
that five-day supplementation with creatine monohydrate, a commonly used aid, did not
enhance the anaerobic power in trained wrestlers [103]. Sodium bicarbonate, administered
at 0.3 g/kg of body mass, appears to be an effective ergogenic aid, but it is often associated
with side effects like intestinal discomfort. Additionally, beta-alanine supplementation has
been reported to cause paresthesia after a single intake. As a result, combining sodium
bicarbonate and beta-alanine may be a more effective strategy, as suggested by Lancha
Junior et al. [104].

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571
22 of 32
Despite the strong scientific support for the combined use of bicarbonate and beta-
alanine, as well as creatine with beta-alanine, in enhancing performance in high-intensity
exercises, the benefits might vary depending on the specific type of exercise and the athlete’s
training state. This indicates that the effectiveness of these supplements can be contingent
upon individual athletic profiles and the nature of the exercise being undertaken. Conse-
quently, there is a need for further research to unravel the intricacies of these synergistic
effects and to tailor supplement strategies more effectively for individual athletes. This ap-
proach will aid in optimizing performance while also considering the unique physiological
responses of each athlete [105].
11. Future Directions in Sports Nutrition Research
The trajectory of sports nutrition research is increasingly aligning with the paradigm
of personalized nutrition, recognizing the unique interplay between diet and athletic
performance. This shift acknowledges the diversity in individual responses to dietary
interventions, influenced by a variety of factors including genetics, microbiome compo-
sition, and metabolic rate. The burgeoning field of nutrigenomics, which explores the
interaction between nutrition and genes, is set to play a pivotal role. By understanding
genetic variations that affect nutrient metabolism and dietary responses, researchers can
develop more nuanced dietary strategies to optimize body composition, enhance recovery,
and elevate overall athletic performance.
In parallel, the role of the gut microbiome in sports performance is gaining unprece-
dented attention. The gut microbiota, with its profound influence on nutrient metabolism,
immune function, and mental well-being, is a critical determinant of athletic perfor-
mance [215]. Future research is expected to dissect how dietary interventions can modulate
the gut microbiome, thereby influencing performance outcomes. This exploration is par-
ticularly relevant in the context of personalized nutrition, as the gut microbiome varies
significantly among individuals. Furthermore, the integration of advanced technology
and data analytics is another frontier. Wearable technology and mobile applications are
revolutionizing the way dietary intake, physiological responses, and performance metrics
are monitored and analyzed in real time [216]. Coupled with the power of machine learning
and artificial intelligence, these tools can synthesize vast amounts of data to provide tailored
nutritional recommendations, aligning with the unique physiological and performance
needs of each athlete.
This evolution in sports nutrition research is not isolated but is deeply interconnected
with various aspects of athletic performance and health. For instance, understanding
the relationship between body composition and performance is crucial in personalizing
dietary strategies. Different sports have distinct nutritional requirements, and evaluating
current dietary practices of athletes provides a baseline for personalized interventions.
Factors affecting nutritional choices, such as cultural influences and accessibility, must be
considered in developing tailored dietary plans. Moreover, the interplay between nutrition
and training adaptations is a critical area of focus. Personalized nutrition strategies can
significantly influence how athletes adapt to training stimuli, impacting muscle recovery,
energy utilization, and overall performance efficiency. Optimal nutrition for recovery is
another critical aspect, where personalized dietary interventions can expedite recovery
processes, reduce injury risk, and enhance training outcomes.
The impact of dietary practices on health extends beyond performance enhancement
to encompass long-term health and well-being. Personalized nutrition strategies must
balance performance goals with the prevention of nutrition-related chronic diseases. In
this context, interventions to improve dietary practices are essential. These interventions,
grounded in personalized nutrition, can range from educational programs to the use of
advanced technologies for dietary monitoring and feedback. Then, the future of sports
nutrition research is a tapestry woven with the threads of personalized nutrition, advanced
technology, and a deep understanding of the multifaceted nature of diet, health, and athletic
performance. This holistic approach promises not only to enhance the performance of

Nutrients 2024, 16, 571

athletes but also to contribute to their overall well-being and long-term health. As this field
evolves, it will undoubtedly offer groundbreaking insights and innovative strategies that
will redefine the landscape of sports nutrition.
