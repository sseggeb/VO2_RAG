Abstract
The ‘cycling hour‐record’ is one of the most prestigious events in cycling. However,
little detailed analysis of such attempts is available. In preparation for a successful
cycling hour‐record attempt, an elite cyclist performed a full‐hour simulation to
provide insights into performance, physiological, aerodynamic and biomechanical
limitations that could be identified in the preparation for a subsequent official
attempt. Performance (speed, lap time, power and cadence), physiological (heart
rate and estimated body temperature), aerodynamic (CDA, helmet angle, rotation
and rock) and biomechanical (helmet, thigh and foot position changes) measure-
ments were made throughout the attempt, in which an even‐pacing strategy was
employed where the point of task failure was defined as the lap which the rider
could no longer perform at the targeted lap split (16.6 s) or quicker. The cyclist did
not achieve the target distance (54,000 m) during the simulation. The final distance
achieved for the hour was 53,250 m. Task failure occurred at 38 min and 33 s (lap
139/34,750 m) into the simulation. Notably, there was a decrease in power output,
accompanied with an increase in the estimated body temperature, changes in
pedalling kinematics and an increase in aerodynamic drag. The reduction in per-
formance (leading to task failure) during a cycling hour record simulation is
underpinned by a decrease in power output as well as an increase in aerodynamic
drag due to biomechanical changes in the cycling technique.

INTRODUCTION
The ‘cycling hour‐record’ is one of the most prestigious events in
cycling and requires a cyclist to ride as far as possible in 1 hour from
a stationary start around a velodrome track. Francesco Moser's
record‐breaking mark of 51.151 km in 1984 brought in an era of
rapid advances in technology, including aerodynamics (Malizia
et al., 2021), which continued in the 1990s and culminated with Chris
Boardman's ‘superman’ position achieving 56.375 km. This subse-
quently led to the international cycling governing body, Union
Cycliste Internationale
(UCI), banning
certain positions,
which
resulted in a diminished number of attempts. In 2014, the UCI
announced an update in the rules, allowing bicycle geometry and
equipment that complies with current rules for time‐trial (TT) events
to be used on the track. This permitted riders to adopt their accus-
tomed TT positions making the cycling hour record more appealing,
ushering in a Unified era (Harnish et al., 2024). At the time of writing
this manuscript, a total of 26 official men's attempts have been made
in this Unified era, of which 8 have succeeded in breaking the record,
which currently stands at 56.792 km by Filipo Ganna.
There is no doubt that the cycling hour record represents a rare
insight into the limits of human endurance performance. The basis of
the task is to achieve a high average speed >55kmh (~35mph),
requiring the development of high levels of sustained power output
(Malizia et al., 2021). The underpinning physiological determinants of
endurance performance are well‐established as outlined by Joyner
and
Coyle
(2008)
and
are
crucial
for
task
success
(Joyner
et al., 2008). They include highly developed aerobic capacity (VO2max)
and submaximal thresholds (critical power (CP)/lactate threshold)
permitting high levels of sustainable power. Another critical compo-
nent of the endurance performance model is mechanical efficiency,
which is underpinned by multiple physiological determinants as well
as the biomechanics of the cycling technique.
Cycling hour record attempts that fail are usually due to the
inability to achieve or maintain the required speed throughout
the hour, which can be considered as one definition of task failure,
the determinants of which are complex and multifactorial. Clearly,
muscle fatigue, defined as the failure to maintain the required power
output (Porter, 1981) and underpinned by the physiological de-
terminants described above, will play a prominent role. However, it is
likely that changes in the body position (that would influence aero-
dynamic properties of cycling) and biomechanics of the cycling
technique are also likely to play a role but are not usually accoun-
ted for.
Given the rarity of cycling hour record attempts, using a case
report methodology provides the only realistic opportunity to pro-
vide reliable observations from a real‐world scenario. Indeed, little
detailed analyses of such attempts have been performed, with only
one case report published in 2000. Padilla et al. reported observa-
tions in an elite cyclist from simulated efforts during the build‐up to a
successful attempt that exceeded 53,000 m (Padilla et al., 2000).
Despite the potential benefit of establishing a greater understanding
of the overall demands of cycling hour record attempts, it is un-
common for riders who attempt the record to collect extensive data
due to (1) regulations stipulating cyclists are blind to any data that is
directly collected from the bicycle such as cadence, speed and power;
(2) the potential aerodynamic penalty of wearing the instruments
and/or (3) the potential issues setting up the instruments when
athlete preparation is of greater importance.
The following case report is a retrospective analysis of a simu-
lated cycling hour record performed by an elite‐level cyclist in
preparation for an official attempt. The cyclist performed a ‘full‐dress
rehearsal’ to gain an understanding of physiological, aerodynamic and
biomechanical changes that occur in order to inform potential stra-
tegies to optimise performance during the official attempt. The
simulation comprised a unique situation where multiple performance
determinants could be examined in depth and used to understand
variables relating to cycling hour record performance. Furthermore,
to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to task
failure, an even‐pacing strategy was employed where the point of
task failure was defined as the lap, which the cyclist could no longer
perform at the targeted lap split or quicker; however, once task
failure occurred, the participant continued to complete the hour
duration. The hypothesis was that there would be significant changes
in the parameters when task failure was achieved.

Participant
The participant was a male elite international road and track cyclist
(age, 29 years; body mass, 75.2 kg; height, 1.84 m and CP, 353 W)
who had competed at the elite track World Championship and
medalled at the elite road World Championships (Mixed Team Time
Trial). They would be considered as Tier 5: World Class according to
the Participant Classification Framework described by McKay
et al. (2022)

available in the public domain. The data collected were observations
on a single day without an intervention or experimental protocol.
Ethical approval was obtained from Northumbria University in
accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, except
for registration in a database.

Cycling hour record simulation procedures
The cycling hour record simulation was conducted at an international
250 m standard indoor velodrome (National Cycling Centre) in
February 2021, using the cyclist's track bicycle (Electron Pro,
Argon 18).
After arriving at the velodrome and conducting the initial logis-
tical preparation, the cyclist's body mass was measured and a capil-
lary
blood
sample
obtained
for
the
measurement
of
lactate
concentration. The cyclist then performed a pre‐determined warm‐
up on a stationary trainer (Lemond Fitness, Revolution 1.1), which
started approximately 60 min before the start of the attempt. The
warm‐up composed of approximately 22 min at 63% of CP, 3 min
progressive ramp up to 80% CP and finally, 2 min at predicted hour‐
attempt power (~360 W). After the warm‐up, body mass and rate of
perceived exertion (RPE) were measured and another blood sample
was obtained. The cyclist then had 16 min to prepare themselves for
the simulation. During this time, the race skinsuit and race overshoes
(Vorteq Sports, UK), race helmet, (Kask Mistral, Italy) were fitted,
along with biomechanical sensors and the HR monitor. All equipment
used were within the rules of the UCI for a cycling hour‐record
attempt.
Once ready, a short track familiarisation effort on the velodrome
was performed. The cyclist was given eight laps to build speed before
performing 4 km at their pre‐determined race speed (which took an
approximately 9 min). Upon completion of the familiarisation effort,
the cyclist was instructed to exit the track. RPE was measured and
another blood sample was obtained. Subsequently, his track bike was
mounted onto a start gate (Starting Gate, Swiss Timing, Switzerland),
which was positioned on the ‘pursuit line’. A further 7 min of passive
rest was given before the simulation was started using an interna-
tional standard count down timer system (Swiss Timing, Switzerland)
from 50 s.
Throughout the simulation, feedback was given to the cyclist
using four methods, which were within the rules of the UCI for a
cycling hour‐record attempt: (1) each lap, the cyclist was informed of
the previous lap split. This was done by an investigator verbally
shouting the last 2 digits of the lap split. For example, ‘6, 5’ would be
a 16.5 s lap; (2) predicted distance, based on the average speed to
that point, was given every 5 minutes. This was written on a white
board and shown to the participant for three laps to ensure it was
recognised; (3) the velodrome lap board (Swiss Timing, Switzerland)
was constantly updated each lap, so the cyclist could see the total
number of laps accumulated and (4) an electronic tablet (iPad Pro,
Apple), with a 60‐min count down timer, was positioned on the track
side in full view of the cyclist for the duration simulation.
After precisely 60 min, the track bell was rung to inform the
cyclist that the hour was concluded and to complete a further full
250 m lap of the track. The video analysis software (Dartfish,
Switzerland) was used to measure the final distance achieved. The
total distance covered in the hour was calculated as per the UCI
regulation 3.5.031 (UCI Constitution and Regulations, 2023). After
dismounting the bicycle at the end of the simulation, body mass was
measured and two blood samples were obtained within 2 minutes of
completing the effort.

Target distance rationale
The air density of the velodrome, where the actual attempt would
take place (Tissot Velodrome), was expected to be approximately
1.130 kg/m3. Therefore, prior to performing the simulation, the air
density was measured (1.179 kg/m3) and the target distance equiv-
alent lap split was adjusted to estimate the equivalent power
required. To achieve 54,000 m with an air density of 1.179 kg/m3, the
cyclist would need to achieve 54,526 m at an air density of 1.130 kg/
m3, which would break the British record and, unofficially, be second
for the unified records at that time. Therefore, his target was a 26.0 s
opening lap followed by subsequent 16.6 s laps.

Measurements
Environmental conditions. Atmospheric conditions, including ambient
temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure and air density,
were measured continuously (0.5 Hz) throughout using a weather
metre (Kestrel 5200 Professional Environmental Metre, Kestrel
Metres).
Anthropometry. Height and body mass were measured using a
stadiometer (213 Seca Portable stadiometer) and a weighing scale
(Withings Bodyþ Smart Scale, Withings, France), respectively.
System mass. The weighing scale was also used to measure sys-
tem mass, which included everything that was on the bike during the
simulation (including bike, clothing, sensors and fluid/food consumed)
immediately prior to starting their attempt.
Critical power (CP). CP was estimated using training data and
targeted efforts in previous 2 months in the preparation for this
attempt. Average power outputs were obtained during sustained
maximal efforts over 3‐ and 20‐min durations (using the athletes
track bike in a TT position on both a stationary trainer and the track).
Time and power data were fitted with the inverse linear model;
P = W' · (1⁄t) þ CP.
Power, cadence and wheel speed. Instrumented cranks were used
to measure power and cadence throughout the warm‐up and attempt
(SRM Track Science 8th Generation Power Meter, Schoberer Rad
Messtechnik, Germany). The power meter had been recently serviced
and calibrated before the simulation effort. A zero offset was per-
formed before the start of the track familiarisation effort. The gear
used was 64:14 and wheel speed was measured using a Wahoo Blue

SC magnet‐based system (Wahoo Fitness). All parameters were
recorded on a cycling computer (Garmin 530, Garmin).
Heart rate. HR was collected continuously from the start of the
turbo warm‐up until 30 min post simulation via a wireless telemetry
system (Wahoo Tickr, Wahoo Fitness) and recorded to the same
cycling computer.
Blood lactate sampling and analysis. Capillary blood samples (5 μL)
were taken from the fingertip and analysed immediately for blood
lactate concentration using a handheld analyser (Lactate Pro 2,
Arkray), which has a reported overall measurement error of ~3%
(Bonaventura et al., 2015).
Estimated body temperature. Estimated body temperature was
estimated using a wearable device (CORE, GreenTEG AG) on the HR
monitor strap that was sampled every 30 s and recorded to the
cycling computer. The wearable device has shown acceptable levels
of reliability, albeit with low agreement, during a 60‐min of steady‐
state cycling (Verdel et al., 2021).
Coefficient of aerodynamic drag (CDA). CDA were calculated using a
bicycle‐mounted pitot tube computer (Notio Konect [NK], Notio
Technologies) at a frequency of 4 Hz. The NK has previously been
shown to be reliable and sensitive (Kordi et al., 2021). The NK was
calibrated as per manufactures instructions, using the track famil-
iarisation effort. The NK was also synchronised wirelessly and used
to record the power, cadence and wheel speed.
Kinematic analysis. Kinematic data were collected with the use of
5, three‐axis gyroscope and three axis accelerometers (Leomo Labs
Type‐S Leomo). The sensors were attached to the thigh, foot and
inside the tail of the helmet. These sensors have been shown to be a
valid and reliable tool for analysing the ranges of motion of the cy-
clist's lower limbs in the sagittal plane (Plaza‐Bravo et al., 2022). The
foot segment range of the first quarter (Q1), that is, from the top
dead centre 90° forward from the direction of travel, thigh segment
range and pedal smoothness were all calculated. Data were recorded
at 4 Hz.

Data and statistical analysis
All data were averaged per minute or per lap, where appropriate, and
presented as mean  SD. Power and speed were also represented as
60 s rolling averages. Once the point of task failure was identified, all
data prior to and after this point were averaged and compared using
an independent t‐test. Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

RESULTS
The average environmental conditions were ambient temperature,
26.3°C; relative humidity, 23.8%; barometric pressure, 1016.9 mb
and air density, 1.179 kg/m3, which were relatively constant
throughout.
The final distance achieved for the hour was 53,250 m. Average
speed, lap time, power and cadence were 14.91  0.16 m/s
(53.250 km/h−1), 16.88  0.60 s, 348  37 W and 93  4 RPM,
respectively. Task failure occurred at 38 min 33 s (lap 139/34,750 m).
All measures were lower during post‐task failure compared to pre‐
task failure periods (Figure 1, Table 1).
The average heart rate was 172  4 BPM. This remained con-
stant between the pre‐ and post‐task failure periods (Figure 1,
Table 1). Estimated body temperature increased progressively
throughout and was higher during the post‐compared to pre‐task
failure periods (Figure 1, Table 1) and had reached 39.2°C at the
point of task failure, continuing to increase to 39.6°C at the end.
Blood lactate concentration was 1.3 mmol.L−1 at baseline and
1.7 mmol.L−1 following the warm‐up. Following the short track
familiarisation effort, blood lactate concentration had increased to
3.5 mmol.L−1. Immediately following the hour simulation, blood
lactate concentration had increased to 11.8 and 12.9 mmol.L−1 for
the two samples taken, respectively. Body mass decreased slightly
from 76.6 kg at baseline to 76.3 kg following the warm‐up and short
track familiarisation effort and further declined to 74.8 kg (~2%)
immediately following the simulation.
Average CDA, helmet angle, rotation and rock throughout were
0.1637  0.0027 m2, 38.8  3.7°, 9.0  1.6° and 7.7  1.9°,
respectively. All measures were lower during the post‐task failure
compared to pre‐task failure periods (Figure 2, Table 1). Foot
segment range, foot segment range (Q1), thigh segment range and leg
smoothness throughout were 47.1  1.9°, 19.3  4.1°, 52.6  1.3°
and 9.0  2.5%, respectively. Foot and thigh segment ranges were
higher, foot segment range (Q1) was lower and leg smoothness
remained unchanged during the post‐task failure compared to pre‐
task failure periods (Figure 3, Table 1).

DISCUSSION
This case study provides unique insight into physiological, aero-
dynamic and biomechanical factors over the course of a cycling hour
record simulation in an elite cyclist. During the simulation, the cyclist
employed an even‐pacing strategy, attempting to maintain a constant
lap split (16.6 s) and thus maintain a constant power output (and
riding position) to achieve a target distance of 54,000 m. The cyclist
was on course to break the target distance (task success) until 38 min
33 s (lap 139/34,750 m) into the simulation, at which point he could
no longer maintain the speed required to achieve the target distance
(task failure). Task failure corresponded with significant changes in
physiological, aerodynamic and biomechanical determinants of hour‐
record performance.
Task failure was likely due to multiple physiological fatigue fac-
tors resulting in a decrease in power output coupled with a deteri-
oration
of
optimal
aerodynamic
positions.
The
physiological
determinants of task failure during an intense exercise are complex
and multifactorial (Porter, 1981). Clearly, skeletal muscle fatigue is a
major factor, the mechanism of which could be central (e.g., reduction
in voluntary activation of the muscles) and/or peripheral (e.g., accu-
mulation/depletion of muscle metabolites) in origin, although, for
1782

practical reasons, we were unable to obtain data in relation to these
processes. Over the first 30‐min of the simulation (that led to task
failure), the cyclist maintained a power output of ~360 W, which was
higher than his estimated CP (353 W). This supports the previous
observation that Miguel Indurain's estimated power output during
his record‐breaking attempt (~510 W) was slightly higher than his
velodrome estimated onset of blood lactate accumulation threshold
of 501 W (Malizia et al., 2021). Regardless of how these important
‘physiological thresholds’ are defined, both case reports indicate that
cyclists are above their respective critical threshold and working
within the severe intensity exercise domain. Exercise in this domain is
strongly associated with a substantial contribution from anaerobic
energy pathways resulting in progressive changes in intramuscular
substrates and metabolites which increase/decrease until their
respective maxima/minima are obtained (Jones et al., 2008; Poole
et al., 1988), all of which contribute to the muscle fatigue process
(Gandevia, 2001; Sundberg et al., 2019). Indeed, the high blood
lactate concentration (~12 mmol.L−1), measured on completion of the
simulation, supports this notion. These observations also corroborate
with the cyclist's feedback that they were ‘flat out’ and working at a
severe intensity.
Task failure, the fatigue process, was undoubtedly influenced by
environmental conditions. The ambient temperature of the velo-
drome was 26.3°C, which, alongside wearing a full skinsuit represents
a significant thermal stress. Estimated core body temperature
increased from ~38.5°C at the start to 39.2°C at the point of task
failure and continued to increase to 39.6°C at the end. There is
strong evidence that a high internal body temperature contributes to
fatigue in trained subjects during prolonged exercises, particularly in
uncompensable hot environments (González‐Alonso et al., 1999b).
The mechanisms are not fully understood, but it is well‐established
that adenosine triphosphate utilisation may be increased during

exercise in the heat, which is met by an increase in anaerobic
glycolysis and muscle glycogen utilisation (Febbraio et al., 1994). This
is related to the elevated muscle temperature (Febbraio et al., 1994)
and
exacerbated
if
dehydration
occurs
(González‐Alonso
et al., 1999a). The compounding effects of dehydration during exer-
cise in hot environments are also significant, including a reduction in
skeletal muscle blood flow to the exercising muscles and reduced
muscle O2 uptake (González‐Alonso et al., 1998). The extent of
dehydration sustained by the cyclist was not assessed directly.
However, body mass declined by ~2%, most of which was likely due
to fluid loss through sweat. Moreover, this level of dehydration is
well within the normal ranges that are considered to be a major
determinant of exercise performance and therefore unlikely to be a
factor in task failure (Cheung et al. (2015)/Wall et al. (2015)). Either
way, these observations align with the cyclist's reported perceptual
feedback, ‘After around 40 min, I was just so unbearably hot. I lost
control of my breathing and just couldn't maintain the pace anymore’.
The other major contribution to the reduction in speed was the
significant increase in CDA. The head and helmet can contribute up to
19% of cyclists CDA in the time‐trial position, the most of any body
part or segment (Malizia et al., 2021). In this case study, helmet
movement significantly increased after task failure. Indeed, narrative
feedback provided by the cyclist, suggested they were attempting to
deliver more power in order to attenuate any further decreases in
speed. This consequently compromised the body position, and the
athlete could ‘sense’ that their head was moving more than before,
which likely contributed to the increase in CDA.
The pedalling kinematics data provide insight that allow us to
make some inference on potential changes in the movement strategy
leading up to and once task failure is reached. Although these data
are limited because the instrumentation only provides segment
ranges of motion (i.e., the difference between the minimum and
maximum segment angle within a pedal cycle), the observations
clearly show that the range of motion of both the thigh and foot
segments increased as the task became more challenging. These in-
creases in the segment angle range suggests that under a change in
task constraints (reduction in performance), the participant explores
alternative movement strategies in order to complete the task goal in
a different manner (Martin et al., 2009). It was not possible to say if
there was an associated systematic shift in the pedalling motion
under fatigue, but this could be the focus of future studies. Never-
theless, the data from this study suggests that there is a change in
pedalling kinematics, leading up to and following task failure. How-
ever, it is worth noting that previous studies have suggested that
changes at the physiological or psychological levels are the cause of
reduction in performance and changes in kinematics are the conse-
quence, and are likely to exacerbate task failure (Allen et al., 2008;
Gandevia, 2001; Martin et al., 2009).
Only one other case study, published over 20 years ago, has
reported observations from test/practice efforts prior to a suc-
cessful cycling hour record attempt that exceeded 53,000 m (Padilla
et al., 2000). The authors reported wind tunnel CDA values of
0.244 m2 and, making assumptions of the atmospheric conditions
which were not reported, suggested that the average power that
was required to achieve the target distance was ~510 W. The
current case study suggests that the cyclist produced less power
(38%) and had a lower CDA (39%; although we acknowledge that
CDA calculated from testing in a velodrome cannot be directly

interchanged with wind tunnel tests (Kordi et al., 2021)). These
observations are perhaps not surprising given the significant ad-
vancements in aerodynamic technology over the last 20 years,
including bicycle design, helmet and skinsuit material and design, as
well as optimal on‐bike‐positioning achieved through wind tunnel
testing.

Practical applications
The present case study suggests that the reduction in performance
(leading to task failure) during the cycling hour record is underpinned
by a decrease in power output as well as an increase in aerodynamic
drag. Given the significant thermal stress encountered that likely
contributed to task failure, methods that can attenuate the increase
in body temperature should be employed in the preparation of the
athlete (e.g., heat acclimation and pre‐event cooling strategies). It is
noteworthy that some of these interventions were performed in the
lead up to his subsequent successful attempts where he went on to
break the British hour record within 6 months and the official UCI
cycling hour record a year later. Moreover, a more conservative
‘negative split’ pacing strategy, rather than sustained even‐pace from
the start, was used in the subsequent successful attempt (achieving
55,548 m).

Limitations
The aim of this case study is to focus on the performance of the hour
record and therefore is limited by the lack of detailed insight into the
preparatory training and the cyclist's nutritional strategy in the
weeks and days leading up to the attempt. Moreover, we did not
provide any further insights into the psychological determinants of
cycling hour record performance. Indeed, the decision to partially
disengage (i.e., reduce effort) or terminate endurance exercise (task
failure) is impacted by both psychological and physiological factors
(Marcora et al., 2009). In such situations, motivational dynamics may
play a critical role in overall exercise performance whereby the desire
to reduce effort during exercise conflicts with the performance goal
of the task (Taylor et al., 2022).

CONCLUSION
This case study provides a rare insight into the limits of human
performance during a cycling hour record simulation in an elite
cyclist. It provides a unique understanding of physiological, aero-
dynamic and biomechanical changes throughout the task. From this,
it seems that both propulsive (i.e., mechanical power output) and
resistive forces (i.e., CDA) are significantly altered, both of which have
a major influence on task outcomes (success or failure). These data
could provide the catalyst for others examining the limits of human
performance during arduous endurance tasks.
