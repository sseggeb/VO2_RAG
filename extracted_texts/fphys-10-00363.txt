Background: This study investigated the periodization of elite swimmers’ training over
the 25 weeks preceding the major competition of the season.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of elite male (n = 60)
and female (n = 67) swimmers (46 sprint, 81 middle-distance) over 20 competitive
seasons (1992–2012). The following variables were monitored: training corresponding
to blood lactate <2 mmol·L−1, 2 to ≤4 mmol·L−1, >4–6 mmol·L−1, >6 mmol·L−1, and
maximal swimming speed; general conditioning and maximal strength training hours;
total training load (TTL); and the mean normalized volumes for both in-water and dryland
workouts. Latent class mixed modeling was used to identify various TTL pattern groups.
The associations between pattern groups and sex, age, competition event, Olympic
quadrennial year, training contents, and relative performance were quantiﬁed.
Results: For the entire cohort, ∼86–90% of the training was swum at an intensity of
[La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1. This training volume was divided into 40–44% at <2 mmol·L−1
and 44–46% at 2 to ≤4 mmol·L−1, leaving 6–9.5% at >4–6 mmol·L−1, and 3.5–4.5%
at >6 mmol·L−1. Three sprint TTL patterns were identiﬁed: a pattern with two long ∼14–
15-week macrocycles, one with two ∼12–13 week macrocycles each composed of a
balanced training load, and one with a single stable ﬂat macrocycle. The long pattern
elicited the fastest performances and was most prevalent in Olympic quadrennials (i.e.,
4 seasons preceding the 2004, 2008, and 2012 Olympic Games). This pattern exhibited
moderate week-to-week TTL variability (6 ± 3%), progressive training load increases
between macrocycles, and more training at ≤4 mmol·L−1 and >6 mmol·L−1. This
fastest sprint pattern showed a waveform in the second macrocycle consisting of two

progressive load peaks 10–11 and 4–6 weeks before competition. The stable ﬂat pattern
was the slowest and showed low TTL variability (4 ± 3%), training load decreases
between macrocycles (P < 0.01), and more training at 4–6 mmol·L−1 (P < 0.01).
Conclusion: Progressive increases in training load, macrocycles lasting about 14–
15 weeks, and substantial volume of training at intensities ≤4 mmol·L−1 and
>6 mmol·L−1, were associated with peak performance in elite swimmers.

INTRODUCTION
To achieve the fastest competition performances, elite coaches
periodise athletes’ training loads over multi-year and annual
training
programs
(Turner,
2011;
Mujika et al., 2018).
Periodization
is
the
purposeful
sequencing
of
training
units (long-, medium-, and short-term training cycles and
sessions) designed to produce cumulated adaptations that
peak during major competitions (Mujika et al., 2018). Current
theoretical
models
of
annual
periodization
(Issurin, 2016;
Mujika et al., 2018)
argue
for
cyclical
or
wave
variation
of the training load, evolving from the beginning of each
general training mesocycle toward increasingly speciﬁc and
intensive overload periods before the taper. During the taper
phase, reduced training volume while maintaining intensity
helps potentiate the adaptations while enabling athletes to
recover from the detrimental eﬀects of physiological stress
(Mujika et al., 1996, 2018). The social environment, training
regimes, and competition all place heavy demands on elite
athletes, pushing them to the limits of adaptation (Sandbakk and
Holmberg, 2017; Mujika et al., 2018). Strategically alternating
phases of overload and recovery can limit performance
decrements
through
injury,
overtraining,
and
detraining
(Turner, 2011; Issurin, 2016; Mujika et al., 2018). The progressive
increase in training loads (swimming volume and/or intensity,
strength training and minor competitions) from one macrocycle
to another over an Olympic cycle, and throughout an athlete’s
career, should ensure that the training stimulus persists to yield
new adaptations and progress (Kraemer and Ratamess, 2004;
Platonov, 2006; Lyakh et al., 2014; Issurin, 2016).
Observational studies of small cohorts of high-level athletes
are the main source of data for periodization models for
World-class and Olympic athletes in cross-country skiing
(Tønnessen et al., 2014; Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017;
Solli et al., 2017), cycling (Schumacher and Mueller, 2002),
rowing
(Fiskerstrand and Seiler, 2004),
and
running
(Esteve-Lanao et al., 2005).
These
models
typically
divide
the annual cycle into two to four periods (macrocycles):
general
preparation
periods
(high
training
volume
at
intensities corresponding to powers or velocities associated
with blood lactate concentration ([La]b) ≤4 mmol·L−1
and
strength
training)
alternating
with
more
speciﬁc
periods
at
higher
intensity,
ending
with
the
intense
competitive
phases
(Schumacher
and
Mueller,
2002;
García-Pallarés et al., 2010). In several sports like cross-country
skiing (Fiskerstrand and Seiler, 2004; Sandbakk and Holmberg,
2017; Solli et al., 2017), orienteering (Tønnessen et al., 2015), and
rowing (Fiskerstrand and Seiler, 2004), the general preparation
periods are long (18–24 weeks) and the training load increases
progressively until stabilization. Speciﬁc training periods may be
shorter (8–12 weeks) and reach a peak load followed by a decrease
just before the competitive phase. In other sports like cycling
(Schumacher and Mueller, 2002), triathlon (Mujika, 2014),
and kayaking (Issurin, 2016), the annual periodization is
characterized by shorter macrocycles (12–16 weeks) made up of
general, speciﬁc and competitive mesocycles lasting 2–6 weeks.
The periodization methods of elite endurance athletes who
have progressed throughout their careers display increases in
total training load, volume, training intensity and number of
competitions (Esteve-Lanao et al., 2005; Tønnessen et al., 2014;
Solli et al., 2017). Reports on annual periodization for rowing
(Fiskerstrand and Seiler, 2004; Guellich et al., 2009), triathlon
(Mujika, 2014) and cycling (Schumacher and Mueller, 2002)
generally show an increase in the total load in the summer as
opposed to winter, whereas for cross-country skiing, orienteering
and athletics (Tønnessen et al., 2014, 2015), only the intensity
increases in the second part of the season.
Regarding the training intensity distribution, the pyramidal
model (high proportion of training at [La]b ≤2 mmol·L−1
and a progressive decrease in the proportions at intensities
between 2 and 4 mmol·L−1, and >4 mmol·L−1) appears to
apply to most elite endurance athletes (Stöggl and Sperlich,
2015). However, diﬀerences in the proportions of training
intensities are evident among sports, indicating that intensity
distribution depends as much on sport-speciﬁc techniques as
the duration and energetic proﬁle of the competitive event
(Stöggl and Sperlich, 2015; Mujika et al., 2018). For example,
although rowing competitions are among the shortest in terms of
duration (7–8 min), international rowers (Guellich et al., 2009)
perform 85–90% of their training at moderate intensity
([La]b < 2.5 mmol·L−1) and only 3% at severe and extreme
intensity (>4 mmol·L−1). For elite cross-country skiers, the
training contents (80–90% at <2.5 mmol·L−1, 3–5% at 2–
4 mmol·L−1, 5–8% at >4 mmol·L−1, 10% training for strength
and speed) are quite similar irrespective of the competition
distance (i.e., 1.3–1.8 km for sprint events and 30 or 50 km
for mid-distance events) (Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017; Solli
et al., 2017). Lastly, in weight-bearing sports (triathlon, cross-
country and marathon running), the intensity zone distributions
are similar (about 70–80% at <2.5 mmol·L−1, 20–30% at
2–4 mmol·L−1, and 5–10% at >4 mmol·L−1), even though
the competition events are typically longer (Billat et al., 2001;

Hellard et al.
The Fastest Training Patterns of Elite Swimmers
Esteve-Lanao et al., 2005).
Studies
comparing
the
training
characteristics of world-class athletes versus lower-level athletes
(Guellich et al., 2009; Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017) have
reported ∼15–30%, higher training volumes especially in low
intensity zones at [La]b ≤2 mmol·L−1, and higher amounts of
speed training and strength training. Elite training has changed
over the past 40 years, with most studies reporting changes
in total training volume coupled with a higher proportion of
endurance training at low intensity (Stöggl and Sperlich, 2015).
We sought to quantify the training of elite swimmers over a
20 years period encompassing multiple Olympic Games and
World Championships.
In swimming, observational studies (research not interfering
with training scheduling or regimens) have shown that the
intensity distribution has shifted from a pyramidal model
with a high proportion of aerobic training in the 1990s (over
70% of training at [La]b < 2 mmol·L−1) (Mujika et al., 1996)
toward models with a high proportion of training between 2
and 4 mmol·L−1 in the 2000s (35–50%) (Avalos et al., 2003;
Hellard et al., 2006). These studies, however, report a relatively
small proportion of training above 4 mmol·L−1 (9–12%).
Several elite coaches have shared their annual periodization
programs
for
selected
World
and
Olympic
champions
(Pyne and Touretski, 1993;
Maglischo,
2003;
Barnier,
2012;
Vergnoux, 2014), mainly in case study format. Most programs
follow periodization models close to those in other endurance
sports: organization of the season into two to four macrocycles
of 8–15 weeks, division of each macrocycle into mesocycles (or
blocks) of 2–5 weeks, and progression from general to speciﬁc
training. These reports from coaches at international technical
symposia (Maglischo, 2003) indicate that Olympic and World
champion middle-distance swimmers (200–400 m) follow a
predominantly pyramidal model, with 55–70% of training at
[La]b < 2 mmol·L−1 and 30–40% between 2 and <4 mmol·L−1
(Maglischo, 2003). In sprint swimming (50–100 m), the literature
(Maglischo, 2003) reveals two types of distribution in champion
sprinters and Olympic medallists, with the ﬁrst showing an
annual volume of ∼2000–2500 km with a consistent proportion
(∼90%) of training at ≤4 mmol·L−1 (Pyne and Touretski, 1993),
and the second a smaller annual volume of ≤1500 km of training
at [La]b ≤2 mmol·L−1 accounting for more than 70% of
the volume and training ≥4 mmol·L−1, tending toward 15%
(Barnier, 2012). However, no study has yet detailed the evolution
of periodization patterns and training characteristics (volume
and intensity distributions) over multiple Olympic cycles, and
their relation to competition performance, in a large cohort
of elite swimmers.
The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns
and characteristics of training proﬁles in elite swimming
to gain insight into long-term periodization. This work is
based on a large cohort of elite French swimmers followed
for a median of 3 years. We analyzed the training loads
quantiﬁed over the 25 weeks preceding the best annual
performance of 127 national and international swimmers.
The proﬁles were related to factors such as the year in
the Olympic cycle, event speciﬁcity (technique, distance, and
sex), age, performance level, and training contents. This
information will inform the planning and evaluation of elite-level
swimming training.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Sample
The
detailed
training
programs
of
127
nationally-
and
internationally
ranked
male
and
female
swimmers
and
their competition performance times were recorded over 20
competitive seasons. All swimmers trained in one of two national
training centers. Swimmers were excluded if they had a chronic
pathology (illness and/or injury) requiring medical treatment,
had missed training for 4 weeks or more, or were taking
medication known to aﬀect immune function or inﬂammation.
Only swimmers who met the inclusion criteria were selected.
The experimental study was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the
institutional review board of the host site (Institut National du
Sport, de l’Expertise et de la Performance), and all participants
gave written informed consent. Written informed consent was
obtained from the parents for all participants under the age of
16 years old. In addition, individual swimmer-seasons with very
slow performances or noticeably irregular training programs
were excluded. The study sample therefore comprised 289
individual swimmer-seasons corresponding to 127 swimmers
followed for a median of 3 years (range 1–11).
Sixty swimmers were male and 67 were female, aged between
15 and 30 years. Four swimmers specialized in 50 m and 42 in
100-m events (sprinters); 52 swimmers specialized in 200 m and
29 in 400 m and longer distances (middle-distance). Forty-six
sprint swimmers specialized (although not exclusively) in front
crawl, 27 in breaststroke, 18 in butterﬂy and 14 in backstroke.
Five middle-distance swimmers specialized in breaststroke, 37 in
front crawl, 11 in butterﬂy, 10 in backstroke and 18 in individual
medley. The swimmers competed in 7 ± 4 (mean ± SD)
competitions per season.
Training and Performance Measures
All performance (P) times in seconds at oﬃcial competitions in
Olympic size 50 m pool were recorded. To account for year-to-
year changes in competition conditions – for example, period
of full-body polyurethane-based swimsuits in 2007–2009 – the
performance times are expressed relative to the mean of the 10
best world performance times (M10WP) in a given year for a
given sex, stroke, and distance: Pr (%) = 100·(P−M10WP)
M10WP
, where
Pr indicates a swimmer’s relative performance (the lower the
Pr value, the closer a swimmer’s performance to the current
M10WP). Only each swimmer’s best performance of the season
was taken into account.
The intensities for quantifying the swim workouts at the
two national centers were determined using the method
of Mujika et al. (1996) under the supervision of the French
Swimming Federation. An incremental test to exhaustion was
performed at the beginning of each season (repeated and adjusted
4 times per season) to determine the relationship between blood
lactate concentration and swimming speed. Each subject swam

6 m × 200 m at progressively higher percentages of their personal
best competition time, culminating in a maximal eﬀort on the
sixth and ﬁnal swim. Lactate concentration was measured in
capillary blood collected from the ﬁngertip during the 1-min
recovery period separating the 200 m swims (Mujika et al., 1996).
All swimming sessions were categorized into ﬁve intensity
levels: I1: below 2 mmol·L−1, I2: from 2 to 4 mmol·L−1, I3:
above 4–6 mmol·L−1, I4: above 6 mmol·L−1, and I5: maximal
swimming speed. The speeds corresponding to each intensity
level were then corrected to account for the swimming distance
and rest intervals using Olbrecht et al. (1985). For a female
World champion and Olympic medalist, typical I1 and I2 training
sets were, respectively, 30 m × 100 m with 15 s rest swum in
1:10 min:s with [La]b = 1.5 mmol·L−1, and 20 m × 100 m with
40-s rest swum in 1:06 min:s with [La]b = 3.8 mmol·L−1. A typical
I3 training set for the same swimmer was 12 m × 100 m with 25-s
rest swum in 1:03 min:s with [La]b = 5.8 mmol·L−1. A typical I4
training set was 8 m × 50 m with 30-s rest swum in a mean 28.6 s
with [La]b = 7.6 mmol·L−1. In-water workouts were quantiﬁed in
meters per week at each intensity level.
Strength training included dryland workouts at maximal
strength training (ST) (1–6 repetitions, 80–100% of 1 repetition
maximum: 1RM) and general conditioning (GC). Strength
training was quantiﬁed in minutes of active exercise per week
(Avalos et al., 2003). To simplify and reduce the number
of independent variables, we used the following practical
notations: ∼moderate-to-heavy intensity (MHI; < the sum
of I1 and I2, [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1), ∼severe intensity (SI;
I3, [La]b > 4–6 mmol·L−1), ∼extreme-intensity (EI; the
sum of I4 and I5, [La]b > 6 mmol·L−1), GC), and ST
(Hellard et al., 2017). The categories MHI, SI, and EI were
based on swimming speeds and blood lactate measurements
following
the
literature
classiﬁcations
(Dekerle et al., 2005;
Fernandes and Vilas-Boas, 2012). The upper limit for heavy
intensities
was
deﬁned
as
the
speed
at
the
maximum
lactate steady state, which has been shown to correspond
to [La]b = 3.3 ± 2.5 mmol·L−1 (Dekerle et al., 2005). The
upper limit for severe intensities was deﬁned as the lowest
swimming speed at which peak oxygen uptake is reached, with
the lowest [La]b reported in the literature of ∼6.5–7.0 mmol·L−1
(Fernandes and Vilas-Boas, 2012). For each swimmer and each
season, training for the 25 weeks preceding the best performance
of the season was quantiﬁed.
In this study, we analyzed training intensities and workouts
with four approaches:
(1) Absolute training loads. Each individual swimmer’s mean of
absolute training volumes were calculated over the 25 weeks
preceding the season’s best performance. In-water workouts
were quantiﬁed weekly in meters at each intensity level
and summarized through the individual mean over the
25 weeks. Dryland workouts were quantiﬁed weekly in
minutes of active exercise and averaged over the 25 weeks.
(2) Progressivity. To investigate progressivity in the training
proﬁles, we compared the diﬀerences in each individual’s
mean over the ﬁrst and second halves of the 25 weeks
training period.
(3) Distribution. Each individual swimmer’s mean intensity
distribution was determined. The individual’s proportion
of MHI, SI and EI were calculated as the mean MHI, SI,
and EI over the 25 weeks relative to the mean total in-water
workout over the 25 weeks, respectively. The proportion of
general conditioning was calculated as the mean of the total
dryland training. The proportions of intensity distributions
varied between 0 and 1 and their sum was 1, with the
proportions of general conditioning and strength training
in the form of compositional data (Bacon-Shone, 2011).
(4) Total training load (TTL) and variation in TTL. For each
swimmer and each season, the weekly proportion of pool
and dryland training were scaled as a percentage of the
maximal volume measured at the same intensity level.
Thus, for each swimmer, season and intensity, the values
were rescaled between 0 and 100%, and the maximum
100% was achieved in at least 1 week, which facilitated
comparisons across time and between swimmers. The
weekly TTL calculated as the mean normalized volumes
for both in-water and dryland workouts (all 5 in %)
summarized the weekly training volume and intensity
relative to the swimmer’s capacities (Avalos et al., 2003;
Hellard et al., 2017). The training proﬁle analyses were
based on TTL. The variation in training was measured as
the mean diﬀerence in TTL between two consecutive weeks
(in %). This measure was used to summarize diﬀerences in
variability between training proﬁles.
Covariates
Several factors may aﬀect adaptations to a training program.
We considered the following covariates: age at the time of
competition, sex, stroke, the quarter (phase of the season)
accounting for the relative importance of the competitions (i.e.,
national competitions typically in the ﬁrst and second quarters,
and international competitions in the third), season number since
entry into the study (as a marker of a swimmer’s experience),
and the season of the quadrennial (post-Olympic, World
Championships, pre-Olympic and Olympic seasons) accounting
for the absolute importance of the competitions. We also
considered two distance classes: sprint swimmers specialized in
50-m or 100-m events and middle-distance swimmers specialized
in the 200-m and/or 400-m.
Statistical Analysis
Training for the 25 weeks preceding each swimmer’s best
performance of the season was used in the analyses since
this was the longest period common to all subjects between
the beginning and the best performance of the season. The
analyses were stratiﬁed by two distance classes: sprint swimmers
and middle-distance swimmers. However, there was substantial
heterogeneity in the analysis of the middle-distance swimmers’
training trajectories.
First, we described the sample in terms of covariates. All
analyses were stratiﬁed by the two distance classes.
Secondly, we used latent class mixed models to identify
the TTL pattern groups over time. This model combines a
latent class model to identify homogeneous latent groups of

The Fastest Training Patterns of Elite Swimmers
subjects, and a mixed model to describe the mean trajectory
over time in each latent group, while taking into account the
individual correlation between repeated measures. The hlme
function of the lcmm R-package was used to estimate the model
parameters (Proust-Lima et al., 2018). The training trajectories
were described according to the number of weeks preceding the
best performance of the season using spline functions without
adjustment for baseline covariates. The shapes of the group-
speciﬁc and subject-speciﬁc trajectories were determined by
comparing models with an increasing number of parameters
(1–15 knots in the spline functions of time, a diagonal or
unstructured random-eﬀect covariance matrix, and a class-
speciﬁc or proportional random-eﬀect covariance matrix). The
best model among those with the same number of groups
was selected using the Akaike Information Criterion. Individual
class membership was not ﬁxed, and estimated on the highest
probability of belonging to a given class from a multinomial
logistic model. In each run, the number of distinct classes had
to be speciﬁed. The decision about the number of latent classes
(1–5) was based on both the Bayesian Information Criterion and
interpretation of the distinct groups.
Thirdly, we characterized the highlighted proﬁles in terms
of demographic characteristics, swim specialty, time-variant
covariates, distribution of training intensities, and relative
performance. ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests (if
ANOVA conditions were not fulﬁlled) were used to determine
diﬀerences in training volumes among groups. Paired T or
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (if T-test conditions were not
fulﬁlled) were used to determine diﬀerences within each ﬁrst-
half and second-half pair of training volumes. MANOVAs
were used to determine diﬀerences in in-water training
proportions and dryland training proportions (after applying
the isometric logratio transformation for compositional data)
among groups (Bacon-Shone, 2011). Given the exploratory
nature of this observational study, association tests between
proﬁles and covariates were performed on the assumption that
the number of proﬁles was correct and subjects were classiﬁed
correctly, with a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, and without applying
multiplicity corrections.
RESULTS
Training Proﬁles in Sprinters:
Identiﬁcation
The total number of swimmer-seasons analyzed was 105. Three
groups, each with a distinct training proﬁle, were identiﬁed
over the 25 weeks preceding the best performance of the
season (Figure 1, right axis). The mean probability of belonging
to the assigned group was high (≥91%), indicating very
reliable classiﬁcation. The Long group and the Balanced group
showed two-macrocycle proﬁles with marked ﬂuctuations in
each macrocycle consisting of a progressive load increase in
the beginning of the macrocycle, one or two load peaks lasting
1–3 weeks, and a progressive load decrease lasting 2–4 weeks
corresponding to the taper period. The Stable Flat group showed
a more regular pattern and a longer second cycle (approximately
16 vs. 13 weeks) with a TTL of about 60% with minor deviations
during taper. Respectively, 53, 24, and 23% of the swimmer-
seasons were classiﬁed into the Long, Balanced and Stable Flat
groups. Among swimmers followed for more than one season,
80% did not train with the same proﬁle.
Training Proﬁles in Sprinters:
Characterization
In terms of performance, training contents and distributions,
sprint trajectory groups could be characterized as follows. The
group corresponding to a pattern of Long macrocycles was
the fastest characterized by a medium training load, medium
variability, training load progressivity between the ﬁrst and
second macrocycles, two load peaks (highest load in each
macrocycle) 21 and 5 weeks before their best performance,
and an intensity distribution with a greater amount of training
at [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1 and >6 mmol·L−1. The group
corresponding to a pattern of Balanced macrocycles was
characterized by a low training load, high variability, degressivity
between the ﬁrst and second macrocycles, two load peaks 19 and
10 weeks before the best performance, and a moderate quantity
of training at >4–6 mmol·L−1. The group corresponding to a
pattern of Stable Flat macrocycles was the slowest characterized
by a high training load, low variability, degressivity between the
ﬁrst and second macrocycles, a single load peak 8 weeks before BP,
and the highest quantity of training at [La]b > 4–6 mmol·L−1.
The group corresponding to a pattern of Stable Flat
macrocycles presented the lowest variation (Figure 1), measured
as the mean diﬀerence in TTL between 2 consecutive weeks
(mean variation ± SD: 4 ± 3% compared with 6 ± 3%
for the Long group and 8 ± 6% for the Balanced group).
The Long group showed the best performance (6.0 ± 3.1%)
compared to the Balanced (6.8 ± 3.5%, P = 0.31) and
Stable Flat (7.4 ± 2.9%, P < 0.05) groups, although standard
deviations were high.
Tables 1, 2 presents the predominant demographic and
swimming characteristics of each of the three outcome groups.
The Stable Flat macrocycle pattern group was the youngest
and the Balanced group the oldest (P < 0.01). The Balanced
group was mostly composed of swimmers in the early
seasons of the study period (mostly the September 1992–
September 1996 Olympic cycle) and, similarly, most of the
Stable Flat group was from the September 1996–September
2000 Olympic cycle. In contrast, the Long group consisted
mainly of recent swimmer-seasons (mostly September 2000–
September 2012) (P < 0.001). Post-Olympic and World
Championships seasons predominated in the Long group,
pre-Olympic seasons were most frequent in the Stable Flat
group, and Olympic seasons were frequent in the Balanced
group (P < 0.0001).
Figure 2, 1st row, shows the diﬀerences between the
training proﬁle groups with respect to the volume in absolute
values. With moderate-heavy and severe intensity training,
the Stable Flat group had substantially greater volume than

of the four assigned groups was high (≥90%). The Long and
Balanced groups exhibited two-macrocycle proﬁles with well-
marked intensive and tapering periods. The second macrocycle
lasted about 11 weeks before the best performance for the
Balanced group vs. 16 weeks for the Long group. The Short
macrocycle pattern group showed a more irregular pattern than
the other two with three macrocycles, with the last two lasting
about 10 weeks. The fourth group, the Stable Flat macrocycle
pattern group, exhibited a proﬁle with the lowest peaks around
40% of TTL and a short taper period (progressive decrease in TTL
starting 3 weeks before the best performance). Respectively, 36,
20, 25, and 19% of the swimmer-seasons were classiﬁed into the
Long, Stable Flat, Balanced, and Short groups. Among swimmers
followed for more than one season, 87% did not train with
the same proﬁle.
Training Proﬁles in Middle-Distance
Swimmers: Characterization
Table 3 presents the predominant demographic and swimming
characteristics of each of the four outcome groups. The
Long macrocycle pattern group presented a high swimming
training volume, low dryland volume, medium variability,
progressivity between the two macrocycles, two load peaks 20
and 6 weeks before the best performance, and a moderate
quantity of training at [La]b > 4–6 mmol·L−1. The Stable Flat
macrocycle pattern group was characterized by a low volume
of swimming training, a high volume of dryland training,
medium variability, degressivity between the two macrocycles,
two load peaks 17 and 3 weeks before the best performance,
and a high amount of training [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1 and
>6 mmol·L−1. The Balanced macrocycle pattern group showed
low swimming and dryland training loads, medium variability,
progressivity in TTL between the ﬁrst and second macrocycles,
two load peaks 20 and 9 weeks before the best performance,
and a high amount of training [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1 and
>6 mmol·L−1. Lastly, the Short macrocycle pattern group
was the slowest characterized by a high training load, high
variability, degressivity in TTL from the ﬁrst to the second
macrocycle, two load peaks 18 and 6 weeks before BP,
and a greater amount of training [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1
and >6 mmol·L−1.

in each group are also presented in Figure 4 (right axis). The
Short group showed slower relative performance (mean relative
performance ± SD: 7.3 ± 4.7%) than the Balanced (5.8 ± 3.4%,
P < 0.10), Stable Flat (5.9 ± 3.4%, P = 0.13) and Long (6.3 ± 3.0%,
P = 0.18) periodization groups, although standard deviations
were high.
Table 4 presents the distribution of covariates by group.
Pre- and post-Olympic seasons were the most frequent in the
Stable Flat and Long groups. Conversely, Olympic Games and
World Championships were the most represented seasons in
the Balanced group. Last, pre-Olympic seasons were the most
frequent in the balanced group, and this group also presented
the lowest number of Olympic seasons (P = 0.01). In each
group, more than half the observations were made in experienced
swimmers, except for the balanced group, which presented the
highest percentage of new entries (1 and 2 years) into the
study (P = 0.02).
Figure 5, 1st row, shows that for MHI the Stable Flat
group had a substantially lower absolute volume than the group
corresponding to a Long pattern (P = 0.07) and the group
corresponding to the Short pattern (P < 0.01) (36160 ± 8420
vs. 37950 ± 6870 vs. 40480 ± 8800 vs. 39050 ± 9560 m.wk−1,
in Stable Flat, Short, Long, and Balanced groups, respectively).
SI was higher for the Short group and lower for the Stable
Flat group (2490 ± 1250 vs. 3940 ± 1580 vs. 3270 ± 1310 vs.
2990 ± 1320 m.wk−1, in Stable Flat, Short, Long, and Balanced,
respectively, P < 0.01). In contrast, the group corresponding to
the Stable Flat pattern had the highest volume of ST training.
Between the ﬁrst half (Figure 5, 2nd row) and the second
half (Figure 5, 3rd row) of the studied period, MHI volumes
decreased in the Short and Stable Flat groups, whereas they
increased in the Balanced and Long groups (all P < 0.01). In the
Long group, SI and EI also increased (both P < 0.01). EI also
increased in the Balanced group (P = 0.08), whereas it decreased
in the Short group (P = 0.10). GC decreased in the Short group
and increased in the Long group (P = 0.01, P = 0.04), and ST
decreased in the groups corresponding to the Short and Stable
Flat patterns (P = 0.04, P = 0.02).

and Long groups.
DISCUSSION
This research is the ﬁrst to analyze diﬀerent periodization
methods and their contents over several Olympic cycles in a
large cohort of elite male and female swimmers, including nine
Olympic or World Championships medalists. The study period
covered 20 competitive seasons, resulting in 105 swimmer-
seasons for sprinters and 184 swimmer-seasons for middle-
distance swimmers, with individual follow-up ranging from 1
to 11 seasons. The extent of the modeling is also indicated by
the detailed analysis of the 25-week seasons, which captured
the entire preparation for national competitions and the major
international meet of each season.
The use of latent class mixed models provided empirical
identiﬁcation of three distinct training proﬁles in sprint
swimmers and four proﬁles in middle-distance swimmers. We
characterized these groups in terms of performance, training
load contents, variability of training, progressivity and training
distribution. For the 289 swimmer-seasons, ∼86–90% of the
training was swum at an intensity of [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1. This
training volume was divided into 40–44% at <2 mmol·L−1
and 44–46% at 2 to ≤4 mmol·L−1, leaving 6–9.5% at >4–
6 mmol·L−1 and 3.5–4.5% at >6 mmol·L−1. Although each
training proﬁle showed a large dispersion in the performances,
the group of sprint swimmers corresponding to the pattern
of Long macrocycles (characterized by macrocycles lasting
15–16 weeks, medium training load, medium variability,
progressivity between the two macrocycles, a load peak
4 weeks before BP, and a distribution characterized by a
greater amount of training ≤4 and >6 mmol·L−1) had
the fastest performances. Conversely, the sprint swimmers
ﬂowing the Stable Flat pattern and the middle-distance
swimmers who followed a Short pattern (both characterized
by the highest training load, degressivity between the two
macrocycles, a load peak 8 and 6 weeks before BP, and
a greater amount of training at >4–6 mmol·L−1) were
the
slowest.
These
outcomes
support
the
assertion
that
contemporary swimming periodization should give priority
to macrocycles that last 13–16 weeks, with suﬃcient training
load variability, progressivity between the two macrocycles,
a load peak ∼3–5 weeks before major competition, and the
greatest portions of training at ≤4 mmol·L−1 (∼85–90%) and
>6 mmol·L−1 (∼4–5%).
Training Proﬁles – Distribution of
Training Intensities
The distribution of training intensities in our study cohort follows
the threshold model (Solli et al., 2017) with ∼86.5–89% below
[La]b 4 mmol·L−1 (43% below 2 mmol·L−1), 6–9.5% between
4 and 6 mmol·L−1, and 3.5–4.5% above 6 mmol·L−1. These
proportions diﬀer from those reported for other endurance sports

(running, cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing), which
showed the high prevalence of a pyramidal distribution with
a smaller proportion of training at intensities between 2 and
4 mmol·L−1. These observational studies of exercise-intensity
distribution in endurance sports (Billat et al., 2001; Esteve-Lanao
et al., 2005; Guellich et al., 2009; Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017)
reported that high-level athletes typically perform 75–80% of
their training below the aerobic or ventilatory threshold (about
2 mmol·L−1) and 5–15% above the lactate threshold (about
4 mmol·L−1) (Stöggl and Sperlich, 2015). Our analysis of the
swimming data highlighted a higher percentage of training in
the 2–4 mmol·L−1 zone (44–46%), in contrast to the training
contents for other endurance sports, which show a proportion
of approximately 2–16% of training at intensities in this intensity
zone. In swimming, the speeds and stroke rates corresponding to
intensities <2 mmol·L−1 are much slower than those of actual
competition (e.g., a female World champion performed a set
of 10 m∗100 m corresponding to a [La]b of 1.5 mmol·L−1 at
a swim speed of 1.2 m.s−1 and a stroke rate of 25.5 s.min−1,
whereas her competition speed was 1.82 m.s−1 with a stroke
rate of 49 s.min−1). At these slower speeds corresponding to
[La]b ≤2 mmol·L−1, catch-up coordination induces intra-cyclic
velocity variations and an increase in energy cost (Vilas-Boas
et al., 2011). In contrast, distance per stroke and swimming
eﬃciency have been shown as the highest around the maximal
lactate steady state speed corresponding to [La]b 3–5 mmol·L−1
(Dekerle et al., 2005). In summary, better technical eﬃciency
in the 2–4 mmol·L−1 zone may be one of the reasons for

the greater proportion of swimming training in these zones
compared with other cyclical endurance sports (e.g., cross-
country skiing, etc.).
The fastest proﬁles for both sprinters and middle-distance
swimmers were characterized by a greater amount of training
up to [La]b 4 mmol·L−1 and above 6 mmol·L−1. These
outcomes need to be analyzed in context with the conclusions
of
the
observational
and
experimental
studies
in
high-
level athletes showing greater eﬃciency with the so-called
polarized distribution (∼70–80% <2 mmol·L−1
and 10–
20% >4 mmol·L−1) in running (Billat et al., 2001), rowing
(Fiskerstrand and Seiler, 2004), cycling (Neal et al., 2013),
and cross-country skiing (Tønnessen et al., 2014). However,
relative to the polarized model, the polarized training zones
in our study appeared to be moved upward: the fastest groups
performed a lower proportion of SI (>4–6 mmol·L−1) training
and higher MHI and EI proportions. These results agree with
those of Arroyo-Toledo et al. (2013), who observed in young
regional level swimmers a smaller performance improvement
in 100 m following a traditional periodization (mean training
volume of 23 km per week and an intensity distribution of 69%
<2 mmol·L−1, 25% 2–4 mmol·L−1, and 6% >4 mmol·L−1)
compared with a reverse periodization (weekly volume of
16 km; intensity distribution 49, 33, and 18%) (0.4 vs. 6.9%,
respectively). In summary, 88% moderate-to-heavy intensity,
8% severe intensity and 4% extreme-intensity training for sprint
swimmers, and 89%/7%/4% for middle-distance swimmers, with
about the half performed below 2 mmol·L−1, reﬂects a good
compromise in swimming between technical eﬃciency, sizeable
physiological adaptations and management of training stress.
Training Proﬁles – Olympic Quadrennials
and Their Seasons
Olympic quadrennials and the seasons of the Olympic cycle were
represented diﬀerently in the training proﬁles. These diﬀerences
cannot easily be explained by the (scheduling of) competition
dates as they varied considerably over the 20 years of the
study. The variations more likely reﬂect the evolution in the
training approaches of the coaches who trained the participants.
Concerning the traditional methodological streams, a few authors
have proposed a periodization model at the scale of a single
Olympic quadrennial (Maglischo, 2003; Platonov, 2006; Lyakh
et al., 2014). For instance, Platonov suggested that an annual
periodization composed of two to three macrocycles would be

appropriate for Olympic and World Championship seasons,
and that a multi-cycle periodization (4–7 macrocycles per year)
could be employed in intermediate seasons (e.g., continental
or regional championships) (Platonov, 2006). Maglischo (2003)
advocated an increase in volume and intensity during the years
with Olympic Games and World Championships. However, the
results of the present work do not agree with these assertions. For
sprint swimmers, the most frequent and successful patterns in
Olympic and World Championships seasons showed a medium
total training load and progression from moderate-to-heavy
to severe to extreme intensity training from the ﬁrst to the
second macrocycle. In addition, during pre- and post-Olympic
seasons, we observed higher training volumes at moderate
to heavy intensities [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1 in sprinters, and
higher dryland workout volumes in middle-distance swimmers,
suggesting these years of the Olympic quadrennial should be
dedicated to developing less speciﬁc ﬁtness.
The increased intensity during high-stakes competitive
seasons (Olympic Games, World Championships) has been
observed among world-class endurance athletes on a yearly
scale (Tønnessen et al., 2014, 2015). As the major competitions
of the season approach, the speciﬁcity and intensity of the
training increases and non-speciﬁc training decreases. For the
sprint swimmers in our analysis, it is worth noting that the
Stable Flat macrocycle pattern group was mostly represented
by the September 1996–September 2000 quadrennial, whereas
the group corresponding to a pattern of Long macrocycles
was mostly represented by the most recent quadrennials. We
assume that the periodization methods presented over the
last 15 years in methodological (Platonov, 2006) and sports
science (Seiler and Kjerland, 2006) literature, as well as the
hard-earned experiences of leading coaches communicated
within the coaching community, have prompted changes in
coaching practices.
Training Proﬁles – Macrocycle Duration
and Shape
A 25-weeks study period corresponds roughly to two typical
macrocycles of 12–16 weeks that precede either the national
selection or the major international (summer) championships.

Hellard et al.
The Fastest Training Patterns of Elite Swimmers
Over the study period, 47% of the swimmers achieved their
best performance in the ﬁrst macrocycle (typically leading to
the national selection trials) and 53% in the second macrocycle
(leading to major international competition). In the fastest
sprint group, the second macrocycle lasted approximately 14–
15 weeks. Training plans for some other endurance sports
(Rønnestad et al., 2014; Tønnessen et al., 2014) have similar
cycles or longer. In middle-distance track-and-ﬁeld events
(Tønnessen et al., 2014; Tønnessen et al., 2015), triathlon, and
cycling (Rønnestad et al., 2014), the macrocycles typically last
12–14 weeks or more. Long cycles induce the cumulative eﬀects
in both physiological capabilities and physical/technical abilities
resulting from long-term athletic training (Platonov, 2006;
Lyakh et al., 2014; Issurin, 2016). There is evidence that the
time course of physiological adaptations in training cycles lasts
between 4 and 20 weeks (Holliday and Jeukendrup, 2012). Most
of the metabolic, neuromuscular and cardiovascular adaptations
to training that begin in the ﬁrst 2–3 weeks culminate between
4 and 7 weeks and continue up to the 12th week or more.
Consequently, a macrocycle of about 15 weeks seems eﬀective to
prepare swimmers for major competition.
The fastest sprint proﬁle showed a waveform in the second
macrocycle consisting of two progressive load peaks 10–11 and
4–6 weeks before competition. Training in the several weeks
before a major competition clearly inﬂuences performance, with
a positive impact of the general preparation mesocycle (i.e.,
weeks 9–11 prior to competition) (Hellard et al., 2017). In the
fastest proﬁle, these two peaks were separated by a load decrease.
Conversely, the slowest training proﬁle was characterized by
a stable evolution with little variability. The observed wave
periodization is similar to that described for models in the
methodological literature (Maglischo, 2003; Platonov, 2006;
Lyakh et al., 2014) and in the scientiﬁc and technical reports
describing the training of Olympic and world-class sprint
swimmers (Pyne and Touretski, 1993; Barnier, 2012). In these
models, a phase devoted to developing strength and aerobic
endurance is planned 8–11 weeks before the major competition.
This phase is followed by the development of more speciﬁc
qualities (maximal aerobic power, maximal anaerobic lactic
power, and race pace intensity training), generally 4–6 weeks
before the competitive period (Pyne and Touretski, 1993;
Maglischo, 2003).
The studies on strength building (Kraemer and Ratamess,
2004)
and
the
methodological
recommendations
on
periodizing training loads (Issurin, 2016) argue that undulating
periodization, alternating phases of volume, intensity and
recovery provides an eﬀective stimulus (Kraemer and Ratamess,
2004). As the body adapts rapidly to a speciﬁc type of
physiological demand, volume and intensity changes are needed
to ensure ongoing adaptation and progress (Maglischo, 2003;
American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM], 2009).
Training Proﬁles – Training Volumes,
Variation in Total Training Load
The fastest proﬁle among the sprint swimmers showed medium
variations in training load, whereas the slowest one was
characterized by low variability. The slowest proﬁle in the
middle distance swimmers showed high variability. Systematic
(not excessive) variations in volume and intensity can yield
greater long-term adaptations than training programs with a
single and constant load (Issurin, 2016). Compared with the
linear periodization method associated with long macrocycles
(18–24 weeks or more), which are characterized by progressively
increasing training loads followed by the stabilization that
precedes the load decrease in competitive periods, the training of
world-class endurance cyclists (Schumacher and Mueller, 2002),
triathletes (Mujika, 2014) kayakers (Issurin, 2016), and swimmers
(Maglischo, 2003; Barnier, 2012; Vergnoux, 2014) is characterized
by

mesocycles focused on the simultaneous development of two
to three priority qualities, interspersed with short periods of
reduced training (Maglischo, 2003). These periodization practices
are close to the so-called multi-targeted block periodization
method (Issurin, 2016), which consists of three types of
block mesocycles: accumulation (development of endurance),
transmutation (acquisition of speciﬁc technical motor skills)
and realization (taper, speciﬁc preparation for competitive
events), all of similar duration (2–4 weeks). The aim of
this method is to develop energetic qualities and promote
eﬃcient transfer of general adaptations (strength and aerobic
endurance) to speciﬁc adaptations (anaerobic endurance) with
minimal risk of overtraining (García-Pallarés et al., 2010; Issurin,
2016). The eﬀectiveness of this method was experimentally
conﬁrmed in world-class kayakers (García-Pallarés et al.,
2010), well-trained cyclists (Rønnestad et al., 2014), as a 12-
week block periodization yielded greater improvements in
strength, maximal power output (MPO), power output at blood
lactate concentrations of 2–4 mmol·L−1 and performance than
traditional linear periodization. In summary, in macrocycles
of about 15 weeks, swimmers, coaches and sports scientists
should consider periodization involving two to three mesocycles,
each lasting from 3 to 5 weeks interspersed with recovery
periods (1–2 weeks).
Training Proﬁles – Progressivity
Our results support the positive association between a progressive
load increase from the ﬁrst macrocycle to the second and
sprint performance. The fastest proﬁle showed progressive
increases from one macrocycle to another and even within
the last macrocycle. Conversely, in both sprint and middle-
distance swimmers, the slowest proﬁles showed load decreases
between the ﬁrst and second macrocycles. The conceptual
support for the principle of progressivity was inspired by
the pioneering theory of Selye (1976) (the general adaptation
syndrome), which described the adaptation to stress in three
phases: (1) alarm, (2) adaptation/resistance, and (3) exhaustion.
After an acute response in the ﬁrst phase, adaptation (and
performance) increases in the second phase but can stagnate
in the third phase if the training stimulus remains constant.
Training theorists have argued that the progressive nature of
a training load facilitates a gradual increase in the training
stimulus (Platonov, 2006; Dantas et al., 2010; Lyakh et al.,
2014). Adaptive training processes are thus engaged because
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

Hellard et al.
The Fastest Training Patterns of Elite Swimmers
a stimulus of greater magnitude is induced (Kraemer and
Ratamess, 2004; American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM],
2009). Progressive overloading should be introduced gradually
into a program, and the swimmer should have suﬃcient time
to adapt before coaches impose a new training load increment.
The ACSM recommends that changes in total strength training
volume (reps, sets, and load) be in increments of 2.5–5.0% per
week to avoid overtraining. Although few studies have directly
demonstrated the eﬀectiveness of an increasing training load
compared with a constant or decreasing load in endurance
sports, Dantas et al. (2010) indicated that traditional models
based on progressive increases in load and intensity were most
eﬀective. Moreover, experimental studies suggest that the greatest
improvements in performance and physiological measures are
associated with the progressive nature of the training load.
For instance, cyclists who made the most progress (increased
˙VO2 max and power output at 2 mmol·L−1) after a block-type
training program had more pronounced increases in volume and
higher intensity than cyclists who followed a traditional training
program (Rønnestad et al., 2014). A progressive increase in the
training load over the season, either through an increase in TTL
when it varies in a uniform way, or through the stabilization
of TTL associated with a progressive increase in speciﬁcity and
intensity, is a methodological principle most likely linked to
the progression in performances. Clearly, swimming coaches
should consider increasing the low- and high-intensity training
loads from the ﬁrst to the second half of the approximate 6-
month (summer or winter) season leading to major national or
international competitions.
Take Home Message
For sprinters, coaches must consider the eﬀectiveness of a
progressive total training load from within and between each
macrocycle until the beginning of the taper. Training load peaks
should be located 7, 6, and 5 weeks before major competitions.
For both sprint and middle-distance swimmers, it is advisable to
avoid a large decrease in total training load between macrocycles
and excessive training at swimming speeds corresponding to a
blood lactate concentration between 4 and 6 mmol·L−1.
Limitations
The end of the study period in 2012 is one of the limitations
of this research. A recent review of the scientiﬁc and
technical literature (Hawke, 2010; Barnier, 2012; Vergnoux, 2014;
Vandenbogaerde et al., 2019) gives a more actual description
of training in the last decade. In the period 2010–2018, the
training of middle-distance swimmers (200–400 m) has been
characterized by high volume, long continuous macrocycles,
priority given to aerobic and threshold training, a short taper,
and strong general physical preparation. The distribution of
intensities has been characterized by a predominantly aerobic
distribution, with 55–70% below [La]b ≤2 mmol·L−1, and 30–
40% between [La]b ≤2 mmol·L−1 and [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1.
In sprint swimming (50–100 m), the literature reveals two
models in champion sprinters and Olympic medalists, with
the ﬁrst showing a high annual training volume (∼2,000–
2,500 km) with a consistent proportion of aerobic and threshold
training below [La]b ≤4 mmol·L−1 (about 90% of the total
training time), and the second showing a lower volume (∼1,000–
1,500 km) composed of a high intensity training (volume below
[La]b = 2 mmol·L−1 higher than 70% and volume [La]b = 4
mmol·L−1 tending toward 15%). This swimming training is
associated with daily dryland training focused on increasing
maximum strength, power and training capabilities.
Secondly,
the
training
load
quantiﬁcation
was
based
exclusively on lactate measurements, which provides only a
partial view and is subject to measurement error. Thirdly, several
covariates besides the training load may impact performance
(Bourdon et al., 2017). A swimmer’s basal ﬁtness, current
life constraints, nutrition, recovery measures, psychological
responses and technical quality during training are some of
the potential unmeasured confounding factors. Also, as our
analyses were based on the marginal associations between
the diﬀerent proﬁles in the load changes and various training
characteristics (distribution, progressivity, and variability), the
association between the proﬁle characteristics and performance
eﬃciency cannot be inferred to be causal. A future study should
statistically assess the links between these training parameters
and performance improvement.
CONCLUSION
We identiﬁed training proﬁles from a 20-year cohort of elite
French swimmers and characterized them in terms of relative
performance, season within the Olympic quadrennial, Olympic
quadrennial and training contents. Training practices have
clearly evolved over the years, and advances in scientiﬁc
and empirical knowledge may have contributed to changes
in practices. We note that pre- and post-Olympic swimming
seasons seem to be dedicated to developing less sport-speciﬁc
ﬁtness, while (particularly for sprinters) the Olympic Games
and World Championship seasons show a progression from
low- to high-intensity training from the ﬁrst to the second
macrocycle. In sprinters, the fastest group showed a progressive
load increase from the ﬁrst to the second half of a 6-month
period leading to major competitions. Conversely, in both sprint
and middle-distance swimmers, the slowest groups showed
load decreases between the two macrocycles. A traditional
macrocycle of about 15 weeks, comprising two to three
mesocycles, each lasting about 4–6 weeks interspersed with
recovery periods, seems to be a widely established practice for
preparing swimmers for major competitions. Finally, swimming
training distributions were 88–89% at ≤4 mmol·L−1 (with half
<2 mmol·L−1) and 4% at >6 mmol·L−1, which diﬀers from
the more polarized distributions reported for other endurance
sports. A possible explanation for this diﬀerence could be the
higher technical swimming eﬃciency in the 2 to ≤4 mmol·L−1
training intensity zone.
