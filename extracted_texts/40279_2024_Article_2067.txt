Abstract
Background  Our scientific understanding of the mechanistic and practical connections between training session prescrip-
tions, their execution by athletes, and adaptations over time in elite endurance sports remains limited. These connections are 
fundamental to the art and science of coaching.
Objective  By using successful Norwegian endurance coaches as key informants, the aim of this study is to describe and 
compare best practice session models across different exercise intensities in Olympic endurance sports.
Methods  Data collection was based on a four-step pragmatic qualitative study design, involving questionnaires, training 
logs from successful athletes, and in-depth and semi-structured interviews, followed by negotiation among researchers and 
coaches to assure our interpretations. Twelve successful and experienced male Norwegian coaches from biathlon, cross-
country skiing, long-distance running, road cycling, rowing, speed skating, swimming, and triathlon were chosen as key 
informants. They had been responsible for the training of world-class endurance athletes who altogether have won > 370 
medals in international championships.
Results  The duration of low-intensity training (LIT) sessions ranges from 30 min to 7 h across sports, mainly due to modality-
specific constraints and load tolerance considerations. Cross-training accounts for a considerable part of LIT sessions in 
several sports. Moderate (MIT)- and high-intensity training (HIT) sessions are mainly conducted as intervals in specific 
modalities, but competitions also account for a large proportion of annual HIT in most sports. Interval sessions are character-
ized by a high accumulated volume, a progressive increase in intensity throughout the session, and a controlled, rather than 
exhaustive, execution approach. A clear trend towards shorter intervals and lower work: rest ratio with increasing intensity 
was observed. Overall, the analyzed sports implement considerably more MIT than HIT sessions across the annual cycle.
Conclusions  This study provides novel insights on quantitative and qualitative aspects of training session models across 
intensities employed by successful athletes in Olympic endurance sports. The interval training sessions revealed in this 
study are generally more voluminous, more controlled, and less exhaustive than most previous recommendations outlined 
in research literature.

Key Points 
This study describes training session models across 
intensities applied by world-leading coaches in endur-
ance sports.
Training session models vary substantially across sports, 
mainly due to load tolerance considerations for the 
locomotion modality, seasonal circumstances, and sport-
specific demands.
The interval training session models outlined here are 
more voluminous, more controlled, and less exhaustive 
than recommendations from many published interven-
tion studies.
1  Introduction
Numerous studies published over the last ~ 25 years have 
quantified the training characteristics of elite endurance ath-
letes, in which annual training volumes range from ~ 500 
to ~ 1200 h per year, distributed across 300–600 training 
sessions [1–29]. This large variation among equally suc-
cessful performers is mainly explained by modality-specific 
constraints (e.g., weight-bearing versus nonweight bearing 
sports, type of muscle action involved, cycle/muscle-con-
traction time, and leg-dominant versus whole-body exer-
cise), although individual predispositions also matter [27]. 
Depending on the specific quantification approach (i.e., cat-
egorizing the distribution of whole sessions versus minute-
for-minute time in zone), about 80–90% of endurance train-
ing is performed at low intensity (below the first lactate or 
ventilatory turn point), while the remaining 10–20% is per-
formed at higher intensity [2, 7, 14, 18, 22]. While the inter-
action between training volume and intensity distribution 
is well described at an annual and monthly level in rowing 
[1–5], cross-country (XC) skiing [7, 8, 24–26], road cycling 
[9–12], long-distance running [13–16, 20–23], swimming 
[17–19], and triathlon [27–29], corresponding information 
for prescription and execution of individual endurance train-
ing sessions are sparse.
Training prescription for continuous exercise sessions 
include selection of exercise modality, working duration, and 
intensity, while interval training also encompasses manipula-
tion of number of repetitions, number of series, relief interval 
intensity and duration, and the between-series recovery dura-
tion and intensity [31]. Ironically, interval training sessions 
are often described in more detail compared with continuous 
exercise training [2, 20, 31], although the latter training form 
by far constitutes the largest proportion of training in elite 
endurance athletes.
Session model comparisons across studies and sports are 
complicated because of inconsistent methodological frame-
works (e.g., intensity zones) and terminology. Moreover, most 
of the research within this topic has been conducted on well-
trained but nonelite volunteers who perform training sessions 
that may not be consistent with what “elite” endurance athletes 
perform [31]. Detailed training session descriptions have been 
presented for world-leading long-distance runners and XC ski-
ers [20–26]. These studies show large between-sport differ-
ences in duration for low-intensity training (LIT), and partly 
also for moderate-intensity training (MIT) sessions, while 
the summated duration for high-intensity training (HIT) ses-
sions appear more consistent. Corresponding training session 
descriptions for sports such as road cycling, swimming, tri-
athlon, rowing, biathlon, and speed skating are clearly under-
represented or missing. Due to the large variations in annual 
training volume across endurance sports [30], it is reasonable 
to expect large variations in training session prescriptions as 
well.
Indeed, more research is needed to improve our under-
standing of session model features among elite endur-
ance sports. The very best practitioners are often years 
ahead of sport science in integrating the critical features 
of training [2, 16, 22], and experienced coaches who have 
achieved success with multiple athletes over time are 
likely best capable to describe good session designs and 
identify factors ensuring high training consistency and 
quality [32, 33]. Surprisingly, the practices, knowledge 
and experience of the very best endurance sport coaches 
have received minimal attention in research literature.
Norway has been one of the world-leading sport 
nations per capita in the last two to three decades [34], 
with most Olympic and World Championships medals 
won in endurance sports such as XC skiing, biathlon, 
speed skating, rowing, cycling, swimming, long-distance 
running, and triathlon. One of the advantages of the 
Norwegian system is that endurance sports use the same 
framework for defining training content, facilitating valid 
comparisons across sports. By using successful Norwe-
gian endurance coaches as key informants, the aim of this 
study is to describe and compare best practice session 
models across different training intensities in Olympic 
endurance sports. Within this context, we define endur-
ance sports as disciplines with ≥ 6 min competition dura-
tion with an aerobic energy contribution of ≥    85%.
2  Methods
2.1  Study Design
This study is a part of a larger project investigating success-
ful coaches in Olympic endurance sports, where the overall

aim is to gain comprehensive insights regarding the holistic 
training philosophies and practices at the macro-, meso- and 
micro-level. For the current study, a pragmatic multiple case 
study design was used to investigate best practice session 
models successfully used to attain world-class performance 
in Olympic endurance sports. To investigate the complex-
ity and capture sport-specific dimensions and perspectives, 
the following cases were selected: XC skiing, biathlon, 
swimming, long-distance running, long-track speed skat-
ing (hereafter referred to as speed skating), rowing, road 
cycling, and triathlon. To allow for comparison and contrast 
across sports, all cases were selected within Norway, assum-
ing similar culture and context. Some of the most successful 
and experienced coaches were chosen as key informants.
2.2  Participants
Twelve male Norwegian coaches participated in this study. 
They were all currently or previously responsible for the 
training of world-class endurance athletes who altogether 
have won more than 370 Olympic, World, and European 
Championship medals, mainly with Norwegian athletes. All 
coaches had experience of coaching both males and females. 
Two coaches were involved in XC skiing, biathlon, swim-
ming, triathlon, and long-distance running, while one coach 
was involved in speed skating, rowing, and road cycling. 
One informant coached both swimming and triathlon ath-
letes. Annual training volume measures prescribed by the 
coaches in these sports are presented in Table 1. All the 
coaches provided a written informed consent to participate 
prior to the study and approved the manuscript prior to sub-
mission. The Regional Committee for Medical and Health 
Research Ethics waived the requirement for ethical approval 
for this study and the ethics of the project was performed 
according to the institutional requirements at the School of 
Health Sciences, Kristiania University College. Approval for 
data security and handling was obtained from the Norwegian 
Centre for Research Data (reference no. 605672).
2.3  Procedures
Inspired by the key informant technique in ethnographic 
research, a pragmatic four-step procedure was used to col-
lect and quality-assure comprehensive information on best 
practice regarding key session models across different endur-
ance sports:
1.	 Initially, an extensive questionnaire related to planning, 
conducting, and evaluation of training at the macro, 
meso, micro, and session level was administered to all 
coaches.
2.	 The next step consisted of quality-assurance of data 
through conversations with the coaches and cross-ref-
erencing with historically reported training logs from 
some of their most successful athletes.
3.	 Thereafter, a semistructured interview was conducted 
with each coach by the first and second authors to obtain 
supplementary information related to the qualitative 
aspects of session models among elite endurance sports. 
Within this context, training quality is defined as the 
degree of excellence related to how the training process 
or training sessions are executed to optimize adaptations 
and/or improve overall performance [33]. Each inter-
view lasted approximately 180 min, of which about one-
third was directly related to this study. The interviews 
were audio recorded and transcribed. Formal translation 
and back translation from Norwegian to English were 
performed by the first and third author, respectively.
4.	 During analysis, we involved the coaches in an extensive 
review process and follow-up interviews to clarify and 
ensure that the findings reflected their perspectives on 
best practice training sessions as accurately as possible.
In terms of endurance training intensity quantification, a 
six-zone scale developed by the Norwegian Top Sport Cen-
tre (Table 2) was applied. Modified versions of this scale 
have been used in several previous studies [35–37]. Training

zone determination during practice was determined by the 
coaches based on a holistic interpretation of all the included 
metrics listed in Table 2. Moreover, a modified session goal 
approach based on Sylta et al. [36] was employed. That is, 
training intensity distribution was described in terms of 
the categorical distribution of prescribed training sessions 
across intensity zones based on their execution. In compari-
son with a time-in-zone approach that will overemphasize 
LIT, this method presents a more representative picture of 
MIT and LIT prescription within long-term programming. 
Here, only the main part of the session was considered, 
while warmup and cool down were excluded. We use the 
term “accumulated work duration” (AWD) for interval ses-
sions, and this is defined as the summated duration of the 
work bouts only.
For the purpose of this study, cross training was defined 
as endurance training in a nonspecific mode. Treadmill run-
ning (including antigravity treadmill running), roller ski-
ing, roller skating, ergometer rowing, and indoor cycling 
were considered specific (i.e., not cross training) for runners, 
cross-country skiers/biathletes, speed skaters, rowers, and 
cyclists, respectively.
2.4  Analyses
Numerical information on training session organization 
across intensity zones was systematized in Microsoft Excel 
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) for descriptive 
presentations. Thereafter, this information was compared 
with information from training diaries of successful athletes 
in the respective sports and calibrated among the authors 
and coaches.
To identify similarities and differences within and across 
endurance sports, summaries of common session-model 
features across endurance sports and sport-specific features 
related to planning and execution of training sessions were 
outlined.
3  Results
Table 2 presents commonly applied training session mod-
els across intensity zones among Norwegian world-leading 
athletes in Olympic endurance sports, while Table 3 pro-
vides an overview of how the loading factors are typically 
organized across intensity zones within the same sports. 
Overall, LIT sessions account for approximately 75–80% 
of all sessions. These are dominated by continuous exer-
cise, although swimming, rowing, speed skating, and road 
cycling also apply low-intensive intervals. Athletes from 
all disciplines surveyed performed the vast majority of 
LIT sessions in Z1 and only to a limited extent in Z2. The 
duration of typical continuous LIT sessions spans from 
30 to 420 min across sports, with long-distance running 
on the lower end and road cycling on the upper end of 
the scale. Long-distance running, road cycling, swimming 
and triathlon perform most LIT sessions in the specific 
modalities, while nonspecific cross-training accounts for 
a considerable proportion of total LIT sessions in speed 
skating, rowing, biathlon, and XC skiing.
MIT sessions (i.e., Z3) account for approximately 
10–15% of all sessions across the annual cycle. These are 
mainly performed as intervals, although with large sport-
specific variations. AWD is in the range of 20–90 min, 
and interval times are mainly in the range 5–20 min, while 
work-to-rest ratio is mainly in the range 6–4:1 (Tables 3 
and 4). Biathlon, XC skiing, road cycling, and swimming 
also apply continuous work in Z3, with accumulated work 
duration in the range 40–60 min. In several sports, particu-
larly road cycling, competitions account for a considerable 
part of the overall Z3 volume.
HIT sessions comprise about 5–10% of all sessions and 
are mainly conducted as intervals and competitions in all 
sports. AWD is in the range 15–50 min for Z4, 10–30 min 
for Z5, and 3–15 min for Z6/7 (warmup and cool down 
not included), while work bout durations are in the range 
1–10 min, from 30 s to 7 min, and from 20 s to 3 min, 
respectively (Table 3 and 4). Work-to-rest ratio is in the 
range 3–2:1 for Z4, 2–1:1 for Z5, and 1–0.1:1 for Z6/7, but 
sport-specific differences are clearly present. Competitions 
account for a considerable part of Z4/5 work among elite 
athletes, as most sports have at least 15–20 competition 
days per year (Table 1).
Most coaches reported applying a limited set of ses-
sion models within each zone for week-to-week calibra-
tion/control of performance development. Within these 
sessions, several common features were identified across 
endurance sports that are described in detail in Table 5. 
These include the application of hard–easy rhythmicity, 
few but well-known session models, lactate measurements 
for intensity control, limited use of all-out endurance

The most typical sessions are listed first (example 1), while the other sessions (example 2 and 3) are applied less frequently. Upper range values for duration/distance, sets and repetitions reflect 
typical preparation-period sessions, while corresponding lower range values reflect competition-period sessions. Upper and lower range for interval times denote women and men, respectively
Z intensity zone, LD long distance XC cross country, R recoveries between repetitions (and sets where stated), w/w.o. with or without. “Pure” Z2 sessions are rarely applied in long-distance run-
ning, XC skiing, and biathlon. In rowing, swimming and speed skating, Z2 training is performed for technical development purposes. Warmup and cool down are performed in addition to the 
described interval training sessions. Typical warmup routines for runners, road cyclists, XC skiers, biathletes, and triathletes include 20–30 min in a specific modality where the intensity pro-
gresses gradually from Z1 to Z3 at the latter part (runners and cyclists also perform three to five strides at the end of the warmup). Speed skaters perform 20–30 min cycling in Z1–2, followed 
by 10–20 min skating imitation exercises, four to six skating rounds on track with progressive intensity (Z1–4), and 2–4 × 30–40 s skating in Z5–6. Swimmers typically perform 15–30 min of 
land-based mobility exercises with and without rubber bands, 15–20 min progressive swimming in Z1–3, and, finally, 3–5 × 5–10 s swimming sprints. Rowers typically perform 20–30 min 
ergometer cycling or rowing in Z1–2 and 10–20 min rowing on water in Z1–3, followed by two to three repetitions of accelerated rowing sprints. Cool downs for most sports typically consist of 
20–30 min Z2–1 (i.e., regressive work) in a specific modality, except for speed skaters and rowers, who perform 30–60 min cycling in Z1
In XC skiing, most athletes train around 50% in the skating and 50% in the classic style. All ski sessions for XC and biathlon can also be performed on roller skies. In biathlon, all Z3-4 sessions 
can include shooting during the rest intervals. Specific rowing sessions can be performed on a rowing ergometer. Similarly, specific speed-skating sessions can be performed on roller skates. 
The running sessions for triathletes can be performed on paved/dirt roads or rubberized track

training sessions, mixing intensity zones within sessions, 
slight progressive intensity increases throughout the hard 
session(s), adjustments of session models during altitude 
training, and a preference towards passive instead of active 
recoveries during interval sessions. Moreover, some com-
mon characteristics related to the coaches’ focus before, 
during, and after the sessions are also present (Table 5).
Although several consistent approaches were observed 
in terms of training session organization and implementa-
tion, some sport-specific features were identified related to 
planning and execution of training sessions (Table 6). Differ-
ences in session models across sports are mainly explained 
by competition-specific demands, seasonal considerations, 
logistic factors, movement constraints for the modality, and 
associated load-tolerance considerations.
4  Discussion
This is the first study to describe and compare training ses-
sion models across intensities and endurance sports. The 
duration of LIT sessions varies substantially across sports, 
ranging from 30 min to 7 h, mainly due to modality-specific 
constraints and load tolerance considerations, while MIT 
and HIT sessions differ less across sports and are mainly 
conducted as intervals (or competitions) in specific modali-
ties. Overall, both MIT and HIT interval sessions are char-
acterized by a high AWD, a progressive increase in intensity 
throughout the session, and a controlled rather than exhaus-
tive execution approach. In the following paragraphs, we 
will discuss the quantitative and qualitative aspects of these 
session models and potential underlying mechanisms in 
more detail.
This study clearly demonstrates that LIT is the most pre-
scribed type of training session in elite endurance sport, in 
line with previous studies based on quantification of training 
performed [2, 7, 13, 14, 18, 22, 38]. Most LIT sessions are 
prescribed and executed in Z1, interspersed with Z2 once-
to-twice per week, or as part of progressive Z1-sessions. 
This distinct feature would not have been detected by the 
commonly applied three-zone scale (LIT, MIT, and HIT), 
emphasizing the advantage of a more categorized scale (e.g., 
a six-zone scale as in this study). In this context, it is impor-
tant to emphasize that elite endurance athletes have a broad 
intensity range below the first lactate turn point compared 
with recreational and moderately trained performers. This 
makes the potential range of intensity and duration com-
binations within LIT larger for elite athletes and a more 
important programming consideration for their coaches. One 
might speculate that Z2 training costs too much for elite 
endurance athletes, making them less recovered and poorer 
prepared for the subsequent intensive sessions. Accord-
ing to several of the present coaches, Z2 training is mainly 
implemented for technical reasons, as an effective force sig-
nature in the movement cycle sometimes requires a mini-
mum speed or power output. Some of the analyzed sports 
perform LIT as long intervals to provide short intermissions 
for nutrition/fueling, technical feedback, and lactate meas-
urements. However, since the latter intervals are quite long 
and the intermittent recoveries are relatively short, such 
sessions practically act as continuous LIT sessions from a 
perceptual and physiological perspective. Similarly, terrain 
variations in sports such as biathlon and XC-skiing make 
LIT sessions more stochastic [39, 40]. The prevailing notion 
is that most LIT sessions must be sufficiently easy to ensure 
that the subsequent hard sessions can be conducted with suf-
ficient quality. LIT sessions have misguidedly been termed 
“recovery workouts” by several practitioners over the years 
[22], suggesting that these sessions do not elicit adaptations 
themselves but rather “accelerate” recovery prior to the next 
hard session. We argue that this interpretation is erroneous 
for two important reasons. First, the concept of any form 
of recovery acceleration from an intervening workout lacks 
support in the scientific literature, although the “low” load 
of such sessions likely causes limited interference with the 
ongoing recovery process. Second, frequent and voluminous 
LIT is considered an important stimulus for inducing periph-
eral aerobic adaptations [41] and improving work economy 
[42, 43]. At least three adaptive signaling pathways (through 
which exercise of different intensities and durations can 
impact protein composition of working muscle over time) 
have well-demonstrated signaling roles, mediated through 
specific kinases, and aggregated by the PGC1a gene [44]. 
The pathways triggered by high energy phosphate depletion 
(i.e., large reductions in ATP/AMP ratio) and by elevated 
production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species both 
show rapidly evolving feedback inhibition of signal ampli-
tude as signal mediated adaptations occur [45–47]. That is, 
adaptive feedback inhibition reduces the adaptive return 
from these pathways with repeated HIT bouts over time. In 
contrast, it appears that elevated intracellular calcium con-
centration associated with the excitation-contraction cou-
pling process remain responsive across longer training time 
frames due to greater potential for modulation via exercise 
duration × intensity interaction, with essentially no feedback 
inhibition of the primary signal within and across motor 
units. Accordingly, it may seem that years of accumulated 
wisdom among elite coaches is consistent with how different 
signaling pathways coalesce to determine the overall adap-
tive enrichment of the endurance phenotype.
Notably, AWD for LIT sessions varies markedly, both 
within and across sports. Within-sport differences are mainly 
explained by session purpose (i.e., extra-long versus short, 
long-slow distance), while between-sport differences were 
explained by competition-specific demands, movement 
constraints for the modality and associated load-tolerance

Best Practice Training Session Models in Endurance Sports
Table 5   Common session-model features across endurance sports
Common features
Descriptions
Hard–easy rhythmicity
Days of hard workouts (i.e., interval training or extra-long slow-distance sessions) are 
systematically alternated with days of easy low-intensity training in between. Most 
coaches advocate two to three hard training days (so called key sessions) per week 
during the preparation period (e.g., Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays)
Double intensive sessions
A total of 7 out of the 13 interviewed coaches practice double intensive sessions (i.e., 
intervals both in the morning and afternoon session of the same day). The main 
purpose is to increase the total volume of intensive training while managing recov-
ery cycles and stress load. In long-distance running, swimming, and triathlon, this 
approach is applied in Z3 sessions. Rowing and speed skating apply double intensive 
sessions in Z4–6 to increase the amount of training around race pace
Cross-training
Most sports apply cross-training (mainly in Z1) to achieve sufficient total train-
ing volume, although in varying degrees. Training sessions in Z3–5 are mainly 
conducted in a specific modality, except for speed skating, XC skiing, and biathlon, 
who perform cross-training systematically also at these intensities (only Z3 for speed 
skating). A common notion among the coaches is that cross-training modality must 
bear sufficient physiological and mechanical resemblances to the specific demands to 
maximize the odds for positive adaptations
Few session models
Most coaches apply a limited set of session models within each zone for predictability 
and week-to-week calibration/control purposes
Mostly controlled, very few “all-out” sessions
Very few hard sessions (competitions not included) across the annual cycle are 
conducted to complete exhaustion, but rather with a “reps in reserve” approach. The 
main purpose with this approach is to increase the accumulated working volume 
at high (but not too high) intensities and ensure that the athletes are sufficiently 
recovered for the next key session. All-out sessions (which are very similar to the 
competition-specific demands) are only performed the last 3–6 weeks prior to the 
main competition of the macrocycle. Elite coaches seek sustainability and optimiza-
tion through session programming, not maximization
Progressive intensity increases throughout the session(s) Most hard sessions are performed with a slight progressive increase in intensity. The 
difference between the first and last interval may be 0.5 km/h during running inter-
vals and 10–25 W during cycling intervals. Similarly, continuous long-slow distance 
sessions typically start at the lower end of the intensity zone, then gradually increase 
to the mid or upper end of the zone as the session progresses
Combination of intensity zones
Table 1 presents the most used sessions models within each intensity zone. However, 
the coaches also implement sessions that combine training intensities. Combinations 
of Z1/2, Z3/4, and Z4/5 are most often applied
Altitude training
Most coaches advocate altitude training. Altitude sessions are conducted with lower 
speed/power output compared to sea-level sessions, leading to lower neuromuscular 
loading. During altitude interval sessions (mainly Z3–4), the recovery periods tend 
to be somewhat longer than corresponding sessions at sea level to avoid accumula-
tion of fatigue and keep the intensity at the desired level
Tapering strategies and easy weeks
During tapering or easy training weeks, about 50% shorter session duration than those 
presented in Table 1 are advocated. The main intention with such sessions is to 
decrease the cumulative effects of fatigue while maintaining fitness/capacity
Passive recoveries
Most coaches apply passive recoveries between intervals. Active recoveries are mainly 
used for training organization/logistic purposes
Coach’s focus prior to the session(s)
The coaches spend considerable time on planning optimal sessions, often in coopera-
tion with the athletes. The training content of key sessions is typically presented 
1–7 days in advance to facilitate athletes’ mental preparations
Coach’s focus during the sessions(s)
The main focus during interval sessions is to provide technical feedback/guidance, 
modify training load variables when necessary, and assist the athletes with intensity 
control (lactate samples, timing/power output assessments, etc.). Similar focus is 
present on low-intensive sessions, although less frequent measurements for intensity 
control purposes are applied. Lactate samples are considered more important than 
speed/power output for developing the athletes’ inner feeling of intensity
Coach’s focus after the session(s)
Most coaches practice debriefing and recapitulation of each session together with the 
athlete(s) to pinpoint what worked well and features for improvements. The main 
intention is to create an arena for learning and enhance training quality for subse-
quent sessions

Table 6   Sport-specific features related to planning and execution of training sessions
Sport
Specific features
Biathlon
Biathletes perform considerable amounts of cross-training in the form of cycling and running, particularly during the preparation 
period when access to snow is limited
The intensity demands during competitions vary according to terrain variations, and biathletes apply sub-techniques optimized 
for different speed-incline combinations. Hence, most (roller) ski-interval sessions are conducted in competition-specific terrain 
with combinations of intensity zones
Z1 sessions are mainly conducted in the lower part of the zone, particularly during running and cycling sessions. However, long-
slow distance sessions may drift to Z2 during uphill skiing to ensure proper technique
Interval sessions are often performed in combination with shooting during the recovery periods. Five intervals are often applied 
to ensure equal amount of shooting in the standing and prone position. Here, warmup shots close to resting state are performed 
in advance for preparation purposes
XC-skiing
XC skiers perform considerable amounts of cross-training (e.g., running with or without poles on soft terrain during the prepara-
tion period where access to snow is limited)
The intensity demands during competitions vary according to terrain variations, and XC-skiers apply sub-techniques optimized 
for different speed-incline combinations. Hence, most (roller) ski-interval sessions are conducted in competition-specific terrain 
with
combinations of intensity zones
Z1 sessions are mainly conducted in the lower part of the zone, particularly during running sessions. However, long-slow dis-
tance sessions may drift to Z2 during uphill skiing to ensure proper technique
L-D running
Long-distance runners generally apply shorter session models than other endurance sports (particularly Z1–3), and this is mainly 
explained by the high mechanical loading demands
Much of the accumulated running kilometres in Z1–3 sessions is undertaken with cushioned shoes on forgiving surfaces (dirt 
roads/forest paths) instead of paved roads to reduce mechanical loading and maximize training volume. The higher the inten-
sity, and the closer to the competition season, the more running sessions are undertaken on rubberized track with spike shoes
Cross-training sessions are mainly applied as alternative training during injury rehabilitation periods, but some athletes perform 
cross-training sessions to cope with the high total training volume during the preparation period
Treadmill running sessions are preferred when weather/winter conditions are poor (rain, snow, ice) and for intensity control 
(particularly during Z3 sessions)
Z1 sessions are mainly conducted in the upper part of the zone, and sometimes in Z2, to ensure proper running technique
Road cycling
Because of the long competition duration, and the notion that cycling is a gentle locomotion modality with low injury risk (disre-
garding falls and crashes), most sessions are in the range 3–6 h
Most intensive sessions are performed as competitions (most road cyclists compete 50–70 days per year). However, each race is 
characterized by a broad range of intensities, depending on the type of competition (mass starts versus time trials, single-day 
races versus. stage races, hilly versus flat terrain, etc.) and role within the team (captain versus domestiques, climbers versus 
sprinters, etc.)
Most of the remaining intensive training (beside competitions) is integrated in LIT sessions (e.g., cycling uphill or cycling with 
reduced drag)
Rowing
Considerable amounts of cross-training sessions in the form of cycling (summer) or XC-skiing (winter) are performed to achieve 
sufficient total training volume. Moreover, warmups and cool downs in conjunction with (ergometer) rowing interval sessions 
involve cycling or XC-skiing, depending on season
Speed training is integrated in rowing-specific long-slow distance or interval sessions 2–3 times per week to improve acceleration 
or top speed
Speed skating Because an effective skating position is muscularly demanding over time (inducing local fatigue, back pain, etc.), long skating 
sessions are challenging to perform. Moreover, the restricted access to ice in Norway during the summer season further reduces 
the number of skating-specific sessions. Therefore, most low- and moderate-intensity sessions (Z1-3) consist of road cycling, 
while most high-intensive sessions are performed on skates. The cycling training increases the tolerance for more frequent, 
intensive, or longer skating sessions. Cycling is also preferred during warmups and cool down in conjunction with intensive 
skating sessions to fully utilize the limited ice access and to provide an aerobic stimulus
Speed-skating intervals (Z4) are typically performed in small groups (mostly two to four but sometimes eight to ten athletes) to 
reduce air drag and thereby increase the speed. However, competition-specific speed training (mainly Z5) is normally practiced 
individually for intensity control purposes
Because speed-skating is muscularly demanding, longer interval recoveries are applied in speed-skating sessions compared to 
corresponding sessions in other locomotion modalities and sports

2947
Best Practice Training Session Models in Endurance Sports
considerations. The latter aspect is in line with Sandbakk 
et al. [30], who recently developed a theoretical framework 
for the impact of physiological and biomechanical mecha-
nisms associated with different locomotion modalities on 
training load management in endurance exercise. According 
to their theory, the combination of weight-bearing exercise 
and rapid plyometric power production in long-distance run-
ning puts high loads on muscles and tendons during each 
step, likely explaining why the duration of LIT sessions in 
long-distance running is relatively low compared to most 
other endurance sports. However, elite runners seem to com-
pensate for this “low” volume by training twice a day and 
performing some of the LIT sessions in the upper range of 
Z1, sometimes approaching Z2 [22].
Speed skating is also muscularly demanding but for other 
reasons. The small angles in the hip and knee, in addition 
to the static upper body position and long duty cycle of an 
effective skating stroke, together induce intermittent blood-
flow restrictions in the working muscles [6, 48]. Hence, 
speed skaters typically prefer cycling instead of the skating-
specific modality during LIT and MIT sessions, as well as 
for warmups and cool downs. Nils van der Poel, double gold 
medalist in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, followed this 
approach to the extreme with 6–7 h rides on the bike five 
times per week during preparation training and considerable 
amounts of MIT cycling in the subsequent phase [49].
Road cyclists perform longer but fewer training sessions 
compared with the other sports. The preference for and 
tolerance of voluminous road cycling sessions can mainly 
be explained by the concentric only and nonweight bear-
ing loading, the long-duration competition format, and the 
fact that cyclists draft behind teammates/competitors and 
coast downhill in substantial parts of the sessions. Care-
ful examination of elite cyclists reveals that 10–20% of all 
cycling sessions are spent at a power output < 0.75 W/kg 
[10]. While a runner absorbs a huge mechanical load when 
running downhill, a cyclist coasting downhill is normally 
resting the active musculature.
Swimming also involves nonweight-bearing exercise and 
low contraction velocity movement [30]. Swimmers perform 
shorter LIT sessions than road cyclists. To obtain a relatively 
high training volume, these athletes seem to compensate by 
consistently swimming twice a day, with the first session 
performed in the early morning. This approach can at least 
partly be explained by restricted access to swimming halls 
in the middle of the day, as school swimming is generally 
prioritized by local authorities. Interestingly, in contrast 
to their high-volume training, most swimming events are 
Table 6   (continued)
Sport
Specific features
Swimming
Interval training is performed across all intensity zones, and continuous work is rarely applied. However, the interval recover-
ies in Z1-2 sessions are very short, so such sessions bare great resemblances to continuous, long-slow distance sessions. The 
application of low-intensive interval sessions is mainly for nutrition/fuelling purposes, providing technical feedback, and taking 
lactate measurements
Crawl is the main stroke for long-distance swimmers during practically all moderate- to high-intensive sessions. Other strokes 
may be used during Z1-2 work, but never constituting more than 30–40% of the total swimming time. The closer to the compe-
tition season, the higher the proportion of crawl swimming
Special equipment (e.g., boards, zoomers and paddles) is sometimes used during Z1-2 sessions for technical development pur-
poses, to increase stroke power output, or to reduce the load during low-intensive swimming
Separate Z1-2 leg sets are sometimes conducted for technical development purposes or development of aerobic capacity
Running is occasionally used at cross-training in Z1 and Z3 sessions during the preparation period, but also as warmup to swim-
ming sessions
To avoid logistic challenges in crowded pools, swimmers apply “slot times” instead of recovery times (e.g., athlete 1 starts at 
0:00, 1:00, 2:00, etc., while athlete 2 starts at 0:15, 1:15, 2:15 min)
“Broken” is a common method for Z5-intervals. Here, the competition discipline (e.g., 800 or 1500 m) is broken down to shorter 
intervals (e.g., 100 m). The aim is to swim the intervals at race pace with short recovery periods in between. The closer to the 
competition season, the shorter the recovery periods
Triathlon
Because triathlon consists of swimming, road cycling and running, combined sessions (so called brick workouts) are frequently 
applied to manage modality transitions. Swimming/cycling or cycling/running are combined for physiological adaptation 
purposes and efficient change of equipment, footwear and outfit. Moreover, athletes try out fuel/nutrition intake during such 
sessions to optimize individual competition routines
The cycling part of the triathlon competition consists of many tight turns, accompanied with decelerations and subsequent accel-
erations. To cope with these demands, cycling intervals are implemented with brief (5–10 s) sprints every 1–2 min to simulate 
the competition-specific situation
It is considered crucial to be up near the front in the initial swimming part of the triathlon competitions, as it costs a lot of energy 
to pass competitors in a crowded open-water swim. Hence, elite triathletes practice fast starts in many swimming interval ses-
sions. For example, the first 25 m of each 100 m interval are at considerably faster than race pace, while the remaining 75 m of 
each interval are conducted at race pace
Brick workouts are designed to simulate competition-specific demands. Because the competition-specific intensity is between Z3 
and 4, most brick sessions are performed at the same intensity. Hence, brick sessions in Z3 and 4 do not differ considerably

dramatically shorter in duration compared with road cycling 
and most other traditional endurance sport events.
Rowing also involves nonweight-bearing and low contrac-
tion velocity movement, but the injury risk of overloaded 
back and ribs, particularly with modern “cleaver” rowing 
blades, has led rowers to implement a larger proportion of 
LIT as cross-training [30]. In XC skiing and biathlon, the 
athletes distribute training time across varying sub-tech-
niques while skiing on snow or using roller skis [7, 8, 25, 
26]. However, the best athletes do not perform longer LIT 
sessions than cyclists, rowers, or swimmers. This can be 
explained by the moderately high muscular loads of skiing 
uphill, in addition to the strong focus on and accompanying 
strain associated with maintaining effective technique (and 
appropriate switching between multiple subtechniques) in 
complex movements [30].
This study shows that many of the best practitioners 
within endurance sports supplement their LIT sessions in 
the specific modalities with cross-training, in line with pre-
vious studies [1, 7, 8, 25]. The application of cross-training 
differs substantially across sports, not only for movement 
constraints and associated load management but also for sea-
sonal reasons. Because of the limited access to snow during 
the summer, XC skiers and biathletes perform many run-
ning and cycling sessions, respectively. Likewise, rowers 
execute numerous land-based sessions as running, cycling, 
or XC skiing (perhaps a distinctly Norwegian cross-training 
modality) during the winter. Other supporting arguments 
for cross-training in research literature include injury pre-
vention, general central capacity effects and prevention of 
training monotony [50, 51]. A plausible question within this 
context is whether long-distance runners should compensate 
for their “low” volume (compared with the other analyzed 
sports) by adding more cross-training sessions to maxi-
mize the training stimulus with lower muscular-mechanical 
load. However, a common notion among the interviewed 
coaches was that cross-training modality must bear suf-
ficient physiological and mechanical resemblances to the 
specific demands to maximize the odds for positive adapta-
tions (Table 5), in line with the principle of specificity [52]. 
Alternative locomotion modalities for runners (e.g., cycling 
and XC skiing) are less used (in most cases limited to injury 
rehabilitation processes) and may be too removed from the 
specific demands, increasing the odds for maladaptations. 
Running is also unique among endurance sports in that cycle 
frequency/cadence does not and cannot be manipulated very 
much across a broad range of intensities/speeds. More spe-
cifically, the cadence may only increase 10% from LIT to 
HIT for a distance runner. For a rower or kayak paddler, 
cadence can vary at least twofold from Z1 to Z5, with the 
force signature maintained relatively stable. These issues 
may partly explain why cross-training in long-distance run-
ning mainly is restricted to injury rehabilitation processes. 
Overall, the underlying mechanism of cross-training remains 
poorly understood, and future longitudinal studies should 
aim to explore the training transfer efficiency of varying 
types of cross-training.
Based on the large variations in LIT session duration 
across the analyzed sports in this study, it is reasonable to 
question well-established training load assessment tools 
such as training impulse (TRIMP) and session rating of per-
ceived exertion (session RPE). While these concepts only 
take training volume and intensity into account [53–55], it 
seems clear that the choice of exercise modality influences 
effort beyond commonly applied external and internal load 
measurements. We argue that these methods are not valid 
for comparisons of training load across exercise modalities, 
for example, by comparing sports or when comparing the 
load across different modalities. Foster et al. [56] have also 
indicated that session RPE is mode dependent, but more 
studies are warranted to verify this feature.
Intensive sessions in the form of MIT and HIT are con-
sidered fundamental for performance progression by all the 
participating coaches in this study, and the planning and 
implementation of training are mainly centered around such 
key sessions. Most MIT sessions are performed as inter-
vals, although several sports also apply continuous work. 
Competitions account for parts of MIT or as elements of 
LIT, and the stochasticity of many competition formats 
such as cycling and XC skiing results in some intensity 
undulation. A specific feature for triathlon is the applica-
tion of combined modalities (so-called brick workouts), 
where swimming/cycling or cycling/running are frequently 
applied during MIT sessions to manage modality transi-
tions. Overall, the analyzed sports implement considerably 
more MIT than HIT sessions across the annual cycle. This 
strategy has been a part of the training philosophy in sev-
eral Norwegian endurance sports over the last two decades 
[57]. Here, a fundamental feature is the application of dou-
ble threshold sessions (i.e., both morning and afternoon) 
twice a week, with blood lactate concentrations in the range 
2–4.5 mmol/L. Marius Bakken, a former Norwegian 5000 m 
record holder (13:06 min) is considered the originator of this 
concept, and he has argued that Z3 intervals (particularly 
microintervals lasting only 45–60 s) allow for accumulation 
of work at faster and more race relevant running speeds than 
continuous training in the same lactate-based zone, without 
the negative consequences of HIT in the form of fatigue 
and subsequent recovery [57]. Half of the coaches in this 
study and numerous elite coaches worldwide have adopted 
double threshold sessions in their weekly preparation train-
ing, representing a novelty in the current training of elite 
endurance runners.
The HIT sessions presented in this study are mainly con-
ducted as intervals, although competitions constitute a sub-
stantial part of most sports. In road cycling, elements of HIT 

2949
Best Practice Training Session Models in Endurance Sports
are conducted during LIT sessions. In triathlon, Z4 sessions 
are often conducted as brick workouts. Overall, a common 
and logical trend across all sports is that interval times and 
accumulated working duration for interval sessions decrease 
with increasing intensity. Recovery time between intervals 
depends on interval time and intensity, but we observed a 
clear trend towards lower work-to-rest ratio with increas-
ing intensity. The variations in MIT and HIT session design 
across sports can mainly be explained by corresponding 
movement constraints and load management considerations 
as explained previously for LIT sessions, although the dif-
ferences between sports diminish with increasing training 
intensity.
Ever since the first studies on interval training were pub-
lished in the 1960s [58, 59], a plethora of research has been 
devoted to this topic. Interestingly, the best practice interval 
sessions described in the present paper differ considerably 
from most of the models tested in previous intervention 
studies that are the building blocks of current established 
scientific recommendations [20, 31, 60]. First, our analyzed 
sports perform interval sessions across a considerably wider 
intensity range compared with research literature. Compre-
hensive and highly cited review papers recommend athletes 
to reach at least 90% of their maximal oxygen uptake during 
interval sessions (or ≥ 95% of the minimal velocity/power 
that elicits maximal oxygen uptake) to elicit both maximal 
cardiovascular and peripheral adaptations [20, 31, 60]. Sec-
ondly, AWD for interval sessions is also considerably lower 
in most scientific studies [31, 60] than those presented here. 
Fundamentally, elite coaches use AWD to adjust both stimu-
lus and progression “between” intensity adjustments (stair-
step model) far more than most recreational athletes and 
researchers, who emphasize mainly intensity as a “lever” for 
managing the HIT prescription. Third, the observed trend 
towards lower work-to-rest ratio with increasing intensity 
has not previously been established in scientific studies. 
However, the predominant application of passive recover-
ies is in line with recommendations from research literature, 
as active recoveries can lower muscle oxygenation, impair 
phosphocreatine resynthesis and, thereby, trigger anaerobic 
system engagement during the following effort [31].
Another notable finding from this study is that very few 
interval sessions are performed to the point of power or 
pace “failure.” Instead, these sessions are characterized by 
an even pacing across bouts or even a small but progressive 
increase in intensity (crossing through, for example, upper 
Z3 to upper Z4), a semiexhausting effort and high AWD. 
Importantly, maintaining good technique (i.e., avoiding tech-
nical collapse and “floundering” near the end of work bouts) 
is emphasized. Some intervention studies have applied 
intervals with maximal sustainable work intensity, aim-
ing to achieve the highest possible average speed or power 
(so called “maximum session effort” or isoeffort approach) 
[61–63]. The interviewed coaches argue that such an all-out 
approach is not sustainable over time for several reasons. 
In a short-term perspective, an all-out session execution 
approach can lead to an undesired and poorly timed peak-
ing response (provided that the recoveries between such hard 
sessions are sufficient). In a long-time perspective, an all-out 
approach limits the accumulated load of MIT and HIT due 
to shorter work time in single sessions and longer recovery 
time after sessions. Concurrently, this increases the odds 
for overtraining and burnout due to the physical and mental 
strain associated with such sessions. The best practition-
ers are, therefore, especially cautious not to overuse all-out 
intensive sessions or introduce them too early in the annual 
cycle [7, 16, 22, 25, 35], a notion in line with traditional 
periodization thinking [64]. Alternatively, controlled and 
semiexhausting interval sessions may effectively stimulate 
adaptation through the interaction between high intensity 
and larger accumulated work that can be achieved before 
the onset of fatigue, compared with an all-out approach [61, 
65–67].
All the key informant coaches in this study consider train-
ing quality highly important for performance development. 
Here, “quality” is not synonymous with “intensity” as often 
seen in popular science literature. Instead, training quality 
is defined as the degree of excellence related to how the 
training sessions are executed to optimize adaptations and/
or improve overall performance [33, 69]. This includes the 
ability to optimize processes that affect the execution of 
training sessions in relation to the intended purpose. Inten-
sity discipline in relation to the training prescription is an 
example of this quality emphasis observed at the elite level. 
Training quality can be developed and fine-tuned over time 
through optimal application of monitoring tools and good 
communication among the athlete, coach, and supporting 
staff. Obtained information related to readiness, exercise 
load, and recovery state form a basis for subsequent decision 
making [69], and this is continuously subject to improve-
ment through a circular learning process where planning, 
execution and debriefing/evaluation are the fundamental 
stages [33, 68]. The present coaches describe a culture of 
continuous learning and development through constructive 
interactions with the athletes.
Although this study has described a variety of session 
models across sports, the best practitioners tend to apply 
a limited set of session models within each zone. In this 
way, each key session acts as a test where heart rate, blood 
lactate concentration, speed/power output, and perceived 
fatigue/exertion can be compared from week to week. The 
principle of control is a fundamental feature of elite sport 
to determine whether athletes adapt to the training, identify 
individual responses, monitor fatigue and accompanying 
need for recovery, and minimize the probability of nonfunc-
tional overreaching, illness and injury [55, 70]. It is also 

2950
	
E. Tønnessen et al.
reasonable to assume that implementation of well-known 
sessions increases the likelihood for increased training qual-
ity. Interestingly, all coaches have primarily adjusted their 
training session models to the individual athlete and sport-
specific demands, rather than based solely on sex, as previ-
ously described more generally [71].
A distinct feature across all the analyzed sports in this 
study is the alternating rhythmicity of hard and easy work-
outs. The legendary track and field coach Bill Bowerman 
popularized this concept in the 1960s [22]. This was also 
a fundamental feature of Matveyev’s traditional periodi-
zation model founded at the same time [64], with strong 
links to the principle of stimulus and response (also known 
as the overcompensation or training adaptation principle). 
That is, training stress leads to acute fatigue and damage to 
physiological structures, and during the subsequent restitu-
tion phase, the organism does not only return to the original 
condition but overcompensates to be better prepared for the 
next stress. The larger the training stress, the longer the res-
titution time required [72]. Importantly, many of the coaches 
regard the training day (not only each session) as the unit of 
stress being managed. Therefore, amplifying the intensive 
load during a planned “high stress” training day is more 
sustainable than adding an additional high stress training day 
to the microcycle. MIT and HIT both induce high stress, par-
ticularly given the high absolute intensities and associated 
metabolic flux of elite performers, combined with the AWD 
that is prescribed and executed. The present study, together 
with other recently published studies, shows that consecu-
tive hard training days rarely occur and that the hard–easy 
rhythmicity also holds true for today’s elite endurance prac-
titioners [7, 16, 22, 25, 35]. Hard and easy sessions seem to 
stimulate a complex set of overlapping and complementary 
adaptations [73, 74], justifying the systematic training inten-
sity variation for performance development in endurance 
sports. Overall, we would argue that elite coaches use this 
day-to-day rhythmicity to carefully manage and, to a sub-
stantial extent, “polarize” training stress, not work intensity, 
to ensure that recovery is achieved. Elite coaching is about 
managing the systemic cost of maintaining a high training 
frequency and volume, and thereby a high adaptive signal. 
Across sports, the success of these elite coaches is quanti-
fied in terms of long-term thinking and “staying healthy and 
being able to do the work required for success.”
Some study limitations should be acknowledged. First, 
it is likely that the present results are influenced by a Nor-
wegian “group culture” bias, and other roads may also 
lead to Rome. Although the key informants in this study 
have coached numerous world-leading athletes, they have 
also applied the same training system to several other less 
successful athletes. Moreover, the intensity scale outlined 
here (Table 2) has been used by Norwegian elite endur-
ance athletes over the last two decades. Previous studies 
have presented several arguments to explain why standard-
ized intensity zone systems are imperfect tools [2, 16, 22, 
37]. Slight inconsistencies in AWD within the same zone 
can be observed when comparing present findings with 
previous studies [16, 22]. Inconsistencies across studies 
are expected because (1) the intensive zones are “narrow” 
(i.e., small differences in heart rate, blood lactate and 
RPE), and (2) MIT/HIT sessions tend to overlap inten-
sity zones. Although intensity scales can be criticized for 
several reasons, we argue that the potential error sources 
are outweighed by the improved communication among 
practitioners that a common scale facilitates.
Finally, we do not believe Norwegian athletes are “phys-
iologically biased” towards a genotype that is uniquely 
responsive to the training characteristics described here. 
More likely, the Norwegian endurance sport success is 
grounded on a culture which includes an appreciation for 
“endurance.” Norwegian champions often describe an active 
childhood that included lots of hiking, skiing, cycling, etc., 
just as a function of living. So, relative to the size of the 
country, we could argue that a large fraction of Norwegian 
children has good local conditions for (1) sampling a variety 
of endurance sports and (2) meeting local coaches with a 
good understanding of the endurance training process.
5  Conclusions
The unique training session templates presented here are 
derived from world-leading coaches, whose athletes have 
won more than 350 medals in international championships. 
Overall, large variations in session loading factors were 
observed across sports, although the differences diminish 
with increasing intensity. AWD for LIT sessions ranges from 
approximately 30 min to 7 h, with differences being mainly 
explained by modality-specific constraints and accompany-
ing consequences for load tolerance. For the same reasons, in 
addition to seasonal considerations, several sports perform 
large amounts of LIT using cross training. Intensive sessions 
(MIT and HIT) are considered paramount for performance 
progression by all coaches, and all sports perform consider-
ably more MIT than HIT sessions across the annual cycle. 
Although most intensive sessions are conducted as inter-
vals, competitions also account for a large proportion. Best 
practice interval sessions are characterized by a controlled, 
nonall-out approach, high AWD, and a slight progressive 
increase in intensity throughout. We also observed a trend 
towards lower work-to-rest ratio with increasing intensity.

Author Contributions  All authors contributed to the study conception 
and design. Material preparation, data collection and analysis were 
performed by Espen Tønnessen and Øyvind Sandbakk. The first draft 
of the manuscript was written by Thomas Haugen and all authors com-
mented on previous versions of the manuscript. All authors read and 
approved the final manuscript. As the authors of this study, we assert 
that our background provides a high level of expertise and experience 
in both scientific research and coaching practice arenas, enhancing 
the qualitative interpretation of these data. Our experience spans over 
30 years, during which we have closely collaborated with world-class 
endurance coaches and athletes, both within the Norwegian Olympic 
Federation (Olympiatoppen) and various national sports federations. 
This hands-on involvement includes conducting training analyses 
alongside coaches, actively participating in training camps, and closely 
observing the day-to-day practices of top athletes. Additionally, many 
of us were involved in the development of Olympiatoppen's training 
diary, intensity scale, and test protocols – all crucial tools in athlete 
performance tracking. Moreover, we have published more than 150 
articles in the field of endurance sports, demonstrating our in-depth 
understanding of the subject. We contend that this experience uniquely 
qualifies us to collect and interpret the data presented here.
