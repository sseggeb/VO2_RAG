'is study aimed to evaluate systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have examined the eﬀect of exercise training on VO2max
in healthy individuals at diﬀerent intensities. Five databases were searched: EBSCOhost, MEDLINE/PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web
of Science, and Google Scholar. Eligibility criteria for selecting reviews included systematic reviews and meta-analyses of healthy
adults that examined the eﬀect of lower intensity training (LIT) and/or high intensity training (HIT) on VO2max. Eleven reviews
met the eligibility criteria. All reviews were of moderate-to-very strong methodological quality. 'e included reviews reported data
from 179 primary studies with an average of 23 ± 10 studies per review. All reviews included in this overview showed that exercise
training robustly increased VO2max at all intensities. 'ree meta-analyses that compared LIT versus HIT protocols on VO2max
reported small/moderate beneﬁcial eﬀects for HIT over LIT; however, the beneﬁcial eﬀects of HIT on VO2max appear to be
moderated by training variables other than intensity (e.g., training impulse, interval length, training volume, and duration) and
participants’ baseline characteristics (e.g., age and ﬁtness levels). Overall, evidence from this overview suggests that the apparent
diﬀerences between LIT and HIT protocols on VO2max were either small, trivial, or inconclusive, with several methodological
considerations required to standardise research designs and draw deﬁnitive conclusions.
1. Introduction
VO2max is the gold standard measure of cardiorespiratory
ﬁtness [1, 2] and a strong predictor of cardiovascular health,
morbidity, and all-cause mortality [3–5]. 'erefore, an
improvement in VO2max (i.e., the functional limit of the
cardiorespiratory system) can reduce the risk of cardio-
vascular disease and mortality—even when other risk factors
are present (e.g., ageing, hypertension, diabetes, smoking,
and obesity) [4, 6]. Exercise training is an eﬀective means of
increasing VO2max [1, 2]. 'erefore, clear recommenda-
tions for exercise intensity are required to facilitate optimal
and eﬃcient improvements in cardiorespiratory ﬁtness.
'e prescription of training intensity falls into two
broad
categories: lower-intensity
training
(LIT)
and
higher-intensity training (HIT). A standardised approach
to the categorisation of intensity has been frequently
established (e.g., LIT refers to exercise bouts <80%
VO2max, whereas HIT refers to exercise bouts >80%
VO2max [7]). And within these categories, three exercise
modalities are commonly prescribed within the literature:
(1) moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT); (2)
high-intensity interval training (HIIT); and (3) sprint in-
terval training (SIT). MICT usually refers to training
programmes consisting of extended duration continuous
exercise at moderate intensities (e.g., 50–80% VO2max)
[8, 9]. HIIT is a form of interval training, which refers to
intermittent exercise that involves alternating higher in-
tensity with lower intensity [10], with high intensity (e.g.,
80–170% VO2max) bouts of exercise between 30 seconds

and 4 minutes [11]. SIT is another form of interval training,
which consists of maximal intensity (e.g., maximal exer-
tion, >170% VO2max), but shorter durations, of up to 30
seconds [12, 13]. Both LIT (i.e., MICT) and HIT (i.e., HIIT
and SIT) protocols have been shown to signiﬁcantly im-
prove VO2max in most populations (e.g., young, elderly,
active/athletic, and sedentary) [14, 15]; however, which, or
if any, exercise training intensity is most eﬀective at in-
creasing VO2max remains unclear.
'ere are several systematic reviews and meta-analyses
available in the existing literature examining the eﬀect of
exercise training on VO2max. However, very little is known
about the overlap of the primary studies included in these
systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses. Hence, the dif-
ferent methodologies employed within each systematic re-
view/meta-analysis will inﬂuence results (e.g., intensity
standardisation and prescription, eligibility criteria, data
analysis, etc.), making it diﬃcult to draw deﬁnitive con-
clusions from any single review. 'erefore, the primary aim
of this paper was to perform an overview of systematic
reviews and meta-analyses that have examined the eﬀect of
exercise training on VO2max, at diﬀerent intensities, in
healthy/nonclinical populations. In addition to an overview
of the available evidence, our secondary aim was to provide
practical applications based on ﬁndings and make key
suggestions for future research for establishing evidence-
based recommendations on exercise training intensity. In
this regard, an overview of systematic reviews and meta-
analyses provides an opportunity to map and summarise the
evidence to date, highlight limitations in the extant litera-
ture, absence of evidence, and identify the key variables that
may inﬂuence the eﬀect(s) of exercise training intensity of
VO2max.
2. Methods
2.1. Search Strategy. Electronic database searches were
performed
through
EBSCOhost,
MEDLINE,
PubMed,
SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using all
available records up to 30 July, 2021. 'e literature search,
quality assessment, and data extraction were conducted
independently by two authors (EC and CP) and any dis-
crepancies were resolved following discussion with a third
author (RD). A combination of search terms was used
(Table 1).
2.2. Study Criteria. 'is review had a series of inclusion and
exclusion criteria, which were limited to systematic reviews
and/or meta-analyses articles. 'e inclusion criteria were (1)
exercise/training interventions; (2) randomised and non-
randomised controlled trials with intervention(s) on healthy
adults; (3) exercise (intensity) group(s); (4) control group(s);
(5) written in English only; and (6) distinction of data, for
extraction, between experimental groups. 'e exclusion
criteria were (1) no measure of VO2max; (2) cross-sectional
study design; (3) patient groups; (4) strength training; (5)
concurrent training; (6) nutritional interventions; and (7)
masters, paraplegic, and/or athletes with clinical conditions.
2.3. Selection of Systematic Reviews and/or Meta-Analyses.
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were selected using
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Figure 1) [16]. 'e
search process included a hierarchy of assessment whereby
papers were ﬁrst assessed by journal title (and duplicates
removed), second by abstract, and third by full-article review
when the journal article was either included or excluded
based on the eligibility criteria.
2.4. Summary Measures. Data were extracted from sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses under two key areas:
background information and training interventions with
VO2max as the outcome measure. Background information
included (1) type of review/analysis (e.g., systematic review,
meta-analysis, and metaregression); (2) the number of
studies included in each review; (3) training intensity groups
(i.e., control, MICT, HIIT, and SIT, which fall under the
umbrella terms of LITor HIT, resp.); (4) sample size in each
training group, and (5) baseline characteristics (e.g., sex, age,
and training status). 'e following training intervention
information was also extracted: (1) modality of exercise (e.g.,
running, cycling, etc.); (2) duration of the intervention; (3)
frequency of training (weekly); (4) exercise intensity (i.e., %
max); and (5) change in VO2max or pre/post-training re-
sults. For accuracy of interpretation, all intensity descriptors
(i.e., numerical and categorical) were extracted from their
original reviews ad verbatim and were not recategorised
within the results section of this current paper.
2.5. Study Quality Assessment. A Measurement Tool for the
Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR)
checklist was used to rate the quality of the literature [17].
'e tool consists of 11 items and has good face and content
validity for measuring the methodological quality of sys-
tematic reviews [17]. 'e total quality score for each in-
cluded review ranged from 0 to 11. 'e quality of the review
was labelled as either weak (score range: 0–3), moderate
(score range: 4–7), or strong (score range: 8–11).
If primary studies are included in more than one review, this
can lead to bias (pseudoreplication) in the interpretation of the
results. A citation matrix of the primary studies was constructed
to assess the degree of overlap between the systematic reviews/
meta-analyses included in the overview. 'e degree of overlap
was assessed by the percentage of primary studies included in >1
systematic review/meta-analysis and the correct covered area
(CCA):(N–r)·(r · c–r)−1, where N is the total number of studies
(including
double-counting);
c number
of
reviews;
r number of unique studies, indicating slight (0 to 5%),
moderate (6 to 10%), high (11 to 15%), or very high (>15%)
overlap [18].

together, the eleven included reviews covered a total of 179
primary studies at 23 ± 10 (range: 9 to 41) studies per review.
Forty-nine (27%) of the primary studies were included in
two or more reviews. 'e CCA was 4.7%, indicating a
“slight” degree of overlap between systematic review/meta-
analyses.
3.1. Study Characteristics. AMSTAR scores (Table 2) for the
included reviews were either moderate [6, 7, 19, 21, 22, 25]
strong [8, 9, 14, 15, 20, 23, 26, 27], or very strong [10, 24]. 'e
number of studies included within each review ranged from
9 [24] to 41 [19]. Control groups included were either de-
ﬁned as: a nonexercise control group (CON) [19, 22] or an
exercising control group (EX-CON) [14, 26], which nomi-
nally diﬀered from MICT but was approximately the same
intensity, and/or a MICT [14, 15, 19, 23, 24, 27] group, with
HIIT [14, 21–25] or SIT [15, 26, 27] accompanying the EX-
CON or CON groups. 'e reviews, in some instances, only
reported the total sample size [21, 24, 25], with other reviews
including the breakdown of participants across the training
groups. All reviews included both male and female partic-
ipants; however, it was evident that there was a greater
number of male participants (68% male vs. 27% female),

with 5% of reviews not diﬀerentiating between male and
female participants. 'e age of the participants ranged from
young healthy adults (>18 y) [14, 23, 26] to older healthy
adults (>70 y) [19, 21]. Table 3 highlights the eﬀect of dif-
ferent training methods on VO2max across the reviews.
Primary modes of exercise included running [19–22, 26, 27]
and cycling [14, 15, 19–22, 26, 27], with other modes of
exercises reported, such as tai chi [19] and snowshoeing [22].
Duration of exercise training intervention(s) ranged from 4
to 38 weeks [15, 26]. Training frequency ranged between 2

and 5 times per week, with all reviews reporting a mean
training frequency of 3 training sessions per week.
3.2. Intensity Prescription. Training intensities (Table 3) pre-
scribed ranged from LIT (60% VO2max or 70% HRmax)
[23, 27] to supramaximal (“all out”) HIT [14, 15, 20, 23, 26, 27].
Exercise intensity was prescribed using a range of measures
(Figure 2) other than VO2max [14, 15, 20, 23, 25, 27], including
maximal heart rate (HRmax) [20, 24, 26, 27], heart rate reserve
(HRR) [19–21, 23, 24, 26]), other VO2max variables (maximal
velocity at VO2max (Vmax) [14, 19–24, 26], velocity at VO2max
(vVO2max) [19–21, 23], gas exchange threshold (GET)
[14, 20, 23], peak oxygen uptake (%VO2peak) [23], maximal
aerobic power (pVO2max) [14, 15, 20, 26], maximal aerobic
speed (MAS) [14, 26]), power output (peak watt work load
(Pmax) [14], work rate at VO2max (%WRmax) [23], maximal
power output (%Wattmax) [21, 24], peak power output (%
PPO) [20, 26, 27]), lactate threshold variables (lactate threshold
(%LT) [23, 27]; velocity at lactate threshold (%VLT) [23, 27],
change between lactate thresholds VO2max (∆LT) [27]), and
maximal exertion (“all out” [20, 23]). 'e measures reported in
this overview were categorised in line with the training modality
(i.e., MICT, HIIT, and SIT) and accompanied by the number of
studies and range of intensities prescribed. It is important to
note that the categorisation of intensity within HIT groups
diﬀers and is not in line with previously standardised categories
[25]. For example, Montero et al. [21] classify HIT at VO2max
between 60 and 80%. However, Montero et al. [24] in a younger
population (22–28 years) prescribed HITas a VO2max between
60 and 95%. Additionally, it is important to note that deﬁnitions
of variables of power output diﬀer between reviews, and in some
instances, diﬀerent deﬁnitions equate to the same prescription
measure. For example, Pmax [14], %WRmax 19, %Wattmax
[21, 24], and %PPO [20, 26, 27] provide similar measures of
power output but use diﬀerent terminology. 'erefore, within
Tables 2 and 3, intensities were categorised in accordance with
the original reviews and not recategorised; however, these in-
tensity variations were taken into consideration for the purpose
of the discussion section. Finally, VO2max as an outcome
measure was either reported as mL.kg.min−1, L.min−1 or %
change in VO2max.
3.3. Exercise Outcome. All reviews included in this overview
showed that exercise training increased VO2max (Table 3).
Reviews that used a nonexercise control comparator showed a
signiﬁcant improvement in VO2max following LIT (i.e., MICT
[14, 19]) and HIT (i.e., HIIT [14, 20, 22, 25] and SIT [20, 26])
[27]. Six meta-analyses directly compared HIT and LIT mo-
dalities [14, 20, 22, 23, 26], which allowed for a meta-analytical
comparison between training intensity groups. Of these, three
[20, 23, 27] reported small/moderate beneﬁcial eﬀects for HIT
on VO2max over LIT [20, 23], but had a high degree of overlap
between primary studies (CCA 11%). However, it is impor-
tant to highlight some discrepancies within/between the reviews
included in this overview, which resulted in exclusion from the
intensity comparison. For example, Montero et al. [21, 24]
included both a HIIT (HIT group) and an MICT (LIT group)
group; however, the intensities prescribed for HIIT were low
(e.g., 60–95% VO2max) compared to other reviews included in
this overview. 'ese reviews could not be considered for further
analyses as they did not have a distinctive HITgroup. 'erefore,
the ﬁndings are principally here limited to a young healthy
participants.

studies. However, further investigation shows the limitation
of current systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, with an
average of only 23 ± 10 studies per review, which highlights
the need for this current overview. 'e ﬁndings of this
overview show that LIT and HIT are both eﬀective at in-
creasing VO2max in both young and old, healthy, and
sedentary, adults; however, some methodological consid-
erations require attention on the interpretation of these
ﬁndings. Evidence from the meta-analyses that directly
compared LIT versus HIT protocols on VO2max was, os-
tensibly, reported as either trivial or inconclusive. 'ree out
of the six included meta-analyses reported small/moderate
beneﬁcial eﬀects of HIT over LIT (α < 0.05) [20, 23, 27].
However, two of these reviews reported “substantial” het-
erogeneity (I2>0.75) [28], small-study bias (p < 0.10) [29], a
relatively small pooled sample size (i.e., <1,000 participants),
had a high degree of overlap (CCA  11%) and reported
several moderators (e.g., baseline ﬁtness levels, age, HIT
variables [e.g., volume, frequency, and duration]), which
likely aﬀected results. All three reviews identiﬁed that,
compared to LIT, HITgenerally elicited a greater increase in
VO2max in older and less ﬁt populations, and/or when long-
interval (2 to 4 minutes of work/bout), high-volume (15-
minute work/session), and moderate/long-duration HIT
protocols (>4 weeks) were prescribed [20, 23, 27]. Fur-
thermore, several primary studies within these reviews
concluded that HIT had greater beneﬁcial eﬀects for older
participants, whereas LIT showed greater eﬀects for par-
ticipants with lower baseline ﬁtness [19, 21, 24]. 'erefore, it
is diﬃcult to conduct a crude comparisons between LITand
HIT, where a more nuanced approach is required (i.e., not all
populations respond the same nor are all HIT protocols
consistent, therefore giving disparate responses because of
other training parameters, rather than intensity per se).
4.2. Systematic Review Findings. In healthy older partici-
pants, Montero et al. [21] reported an increase in VO2max
following a LIT intervention (SMD  0.79, CI  0.41 to 1.17)
with the HIT intervention prescribed at 60–80% VO2max
also eliciting an improvement in VO2max (SMD  0.95,
CI  0.64 to 1.25). Analysis revealed that none of the
assessed potential cofactors (i.e. gender, training charac-
teristics, and methodological quality) moderated the im-
provement in VO2max. Furthermore, Montero et al. [24]
reported similar results in a younger population but found
that training interventions using cycling (ergometer)
showed a greater increase in VO2max compared with
studies
that
undertook
LIT
running
(treadmill)
(SMD  1.06 vs. 0.43). As expected, Huang et al. [19]
showed that older sedentary individuals who performed
LIT (55–60% VO2max) for 30–35 minutes per session,
three times per week for 16–20 weeks, could improve their
VO2max by approximately 3.8 mL kg.min−1 (∼16% im-
provement). Moreover, recent “big data” research, on real-
world running activities of ∼14,000 individuals with ∼1.6
million exercise sessions and a total distance of ∼20 million
km, found that faster runners partake in greater volumes of
LIT than slower runners, which was associated with better
performance during high-intensity exercise [30].
Research has shown that HIT increases VO2max in
healthy adults [24]. Scribbans et al. [22] found that HIT
(80–92.5% VO2max) was a powerful method for eliciting
improvements in VO2max (0.26 ± 0.10 L.min−1, ES  0.68).
Weston et al. [14] included a cohort of both healthy and
sedentary participants, reporting moderate improvements in
VO2max for both active nonathletic (6.2 ± 3.1%) and sed-
entary men (10 ± 5.1%), as well as active nonathletic
(3.6 ± 4.3%) and sedentary women (7.3 ± 4.8%), when
compared to a control group (1.2 ± 2.0%). Wen et al. [20]
found that the degree of change in VO2max induced by HIT
varied by population, with greater improvements seen from
a healthy nonathletic population, compared to an athletic
population. Although all HITprotocols only evoked a small/
moderate increase in VO2max over LIT programmes [27],
long-interval (≥2 min) (SMD  1.07 (CI  0.62, 1.52)), high-
volume (≥15 min) (SMD  1.04 (CI  0.54, 1.54)), and
moderate-to-long duration (≥4–12 weeks) (SMD  0.77
(CI  −0.08, 1.61)) HIT programmes evoked a greater in-
crease in VO2max [20], which highlights that a more nu-
anced approach is required in view of other training
variables alongside intensity during program design. Finally,
Sloth et al. found that 2–8 weeks of HIT, performed 2–3
times a week, showed VO2max improvements (SMD  0.63,
CI  0.39 to 0.87) for both sedentary and healthy participants
[15]. However, when compared to LIT, Gist et al. [26] found
small eﬀects between HITand LIT (SMD  0.04, CI  -0.17 to
0.24). 'ese ﬁndings provide evidence in support of HIT but
as their meta-analysis concluded, the diﬀerence in the in-
crease between HITand LITwas either trivial or inconclusive
in healthy participants.
4.3. Limitations and Future Research Considerations. It is
evident that both LIT and HIT modalities carry their own
limitations. Scribbans et al. [22] noted that a lack of an exercise

intensity eﬀect was speciﬁcally related to LIT interventions
during short-term studies that were not comparable to HIT
interventions. 'erefore, work-matched (i.e., per session and
over the total training period) training loads are required to
make accurate comparisons between HIT and LIT interven-
tions [22]. And the use of training impulse (TRIMP) (i.e.,
usually the product of training intensity and time) may
provide greater insight into the relative eﬃcacy of LITand HIT
interventions [30]. 'is also highlights the need for stand-
ardisation of training with large variation in control of the
independent variable (i.e., intensity) reported between studies.
It was noted that several of the reviews in this overview
prescribed HIT interventions that could have been (re)clas-
siﬁed as LIT [21, 24]. Furthermore, with reference to training
intensity, standardisation is required for some of the other
training variables that are (sometimes inextricably) linked to
training intensity (e.g., frequency, volume, and duration). Gist
et al. [26] stated that the duration of training interventions in
most SIT studies was <6 weeks, questioning the long-term
improvements and adaptations within these studies.
Broader limitations exist around sample population,
study design, and sample size. Whilst some reviews reported
heterogeneity among their included studies [20], others only
included studies of young healthy sedentary or recreationally
active adults [14, 15, 22] or older populations [19, 21]. As
noted previously, there are a greater number of males across
the 11 included reviews. Removing any potential bias
through RCTs is an important consideration. Scribbans et al.
[22] reported that none of their included studies applied
RCTs, Sloth et al. [15] reported only four studies that applied
RCTs design, and Gist et al. [26] reported that the majority of
included studies were RCTs. Finally, small/underpowered
sample sizes are a re-occurring problem, as recruitment,
adherence, and commitment are diﬃcult. Montero et al. [21]
stated that the majority of ﬁndings were derived from a
relatively small number of studies reporting a lack of sta-
tistical power [15] and potential publication bias in sample
sizes of between eight and ten participants, with the ag-
gregation of data suggesting publication bias is likely [20].
'erefore, our overview begins to overcome these issues and
highlights the need for carefully controlled research designs.
Other speciﬁc considerations need to be considered such
as outdated technology, and possibly, how less reliable
methods for measuring VO2max might aﬀect the validity and
reliability of results from early studies [19]. HITwarrants high
levels of motivation and this may present as an issue to long-
term adherence [14]. Finally, the extraction of relative values
(ml.kg.min−1) rather than absolute values (L.min−1) of
VO2max may magnify the training eﬀect due to a possible
decrease of body mass during the training intervention [20].
'ese considerations should provide future researchers with
some guidance around the interpretation of previously
published research and future aggregation of these ﬁndings.
5. Perspective
'e ﬁndings of this review show that both LIT and HIT are
eﬀective at improving VO2max and overlap analysis between
reviews highlights the need for such an approach to
synthesising the literature. Evidence from meta-analyses that
compared LIT versus HIT protocols on VO2max reported
either small, trivial, or inconclusive eﬀects between training
groups. 'ree reviews reported that HIT has potentially
greater beneﬁcial eﬀects for older and/or less ﬁt participants
versus LIT. Interestingly, smaller eﬀects were seen for longer
HIT intervals and may suggest the importance of exercise
intensity even between diﬀerent HIT modalities (e.g., SIT
and HIIT). Finally, several methodological considerations
are highlighted in this overview, such as the sample pop-
ulation, research design, sample size, and intervention du-
ration. Other speciﬁc considerations include technology
used to control, monitor, and administer the exercise in-
tensity, control of other (extraneous) training parameters
(e.g., work, TRIMP), to allow accurate comparisons to be
made diﬀerent exercise intensities, and standardised no-
menclature around training intensity guidelines and cate-
gorisation in research and practice.
