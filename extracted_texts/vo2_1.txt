Abstract
Endurance exercise training studies frequently show modest changes in VO2max with training and very limited responses in
some subjects. By contrast, studies using interval training (IT) or combined IT and continuous training (CT) have reported
mean increases in VO2max of up to ,1.0 L ? min21. This raises questions about the role of exercise intensity and the
trainability of VO2max. To address this topic we analyzed IT and IT/CT studies published in English from 1965–2012.
Inclusion criteria were: 1)$3 healthy sedentary/recreationally active humans ,45 yrs old, 2) training duration 6–13 weeks,
3) $3 days/week, 4) $10 minutes of high intensity work, 5) $1:1 work/rest ratio, and 6) results reported as mean 6 SD or
SE, ranges of change, or individual data. Due to heterogeneity (I2 value of 70), statistical synthesis of the data used a random
effects model. The summary statistic of interest was the change in VO2max. A total of 334 subjects (120 women) from 37
studies were identified. Participants were grouped into 40 distinct training groups, so the unit of analysis was 40 rather than
37. An increase in VO2max of 0.51 L ?min21 (95% CI: 0.43 to 0.60 L ? min21) was observed. A subset of 9 studies, with 72
subjects, that featured longer intervals showed even larger (,0.8–0.9 L ? min21) changes in VO2max with evidence of a
marked response in all subjects. These results suggest that ideas about trainability and VO2max should be further evaluated
with standardized IT or IT/CT training programs.

Introduction
The benefits of an active lifestyle are well documented [1–3].
Many of these benefits are also associated with higher levels of
cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) which may exert protective
effects that are independent of traditional risk factors [3,4].
Additionally, for individuals with low physical fitness, even modest
improvements in fitness can have substantial health benefits.
However, some individuals may have a limited ability to increase
their cardiorespiratory fitness (trainability) in response to endur-
ance exercise training [5,6].
A key study advancing the idea that some humans have limited
trainability comes from Bouchard et al. studied 483 sedentary
white adults from 99 nuclear families who completed a standard-
ized 20-wk endurance training program [5,6]. The subjects trained
three times per week on a treadmill. Initially, they trained at a
heart rate that correlated to 55% of their baseline VO2max for
30 minutes per session. Every two weeks the intensity and duration
of the exercise was progressively increased until each subject was
training for 50 minutes at a heart rate associated with 75% of their
baseline VO2max. This level of intensity and duration was reached
by the 14th week of training and maintained until the conclusion
of the study. Using this approach, they found a mean increase in
VO2max of ,0.4 L ? min21 with a SD of .0.2 L/min.
Additionally, 7% of subjects showed a gain of 0.1 L ? min21 or
less while 8% of subjects improved by 0.7 L ? min21 or more.
Based on this distribution of VO2max responses it appears that
the ‘‘trainability’’ of at least some subjects is low or non-existent
with little or no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness in spite of
20 weeks of structured exercise training [5,6]. These observations
are in contrast to reports from smaller studies that have used either
interval training (IT), or interval training in combination with
continuous training (CT) and shown more robust increases in
VO2max with at least some evidence of marked responses in all
subjects [7–15].
In this context, we sought to explore the hypothesis that all
subjects can show marked improvements in VO2max if training
programs that include periods of high intensity (,90% of
VO2max) exercise are used. A fundamental rationale underpin-
ning our analysis is that the biology of VO2max trainability needs
to be evaluated using regimens designed to maximize physiological
adaptations. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the changes in
VO2max in response to interval training (IT) or combined IT and
continuous training (CT) reported in 37 studies [7–43]. We also
sought to gain insight into the idea that shorter periods of IT might
be either superior or more time efficient at generating increases in
VO2max in comparison to traditional continuous training.

Methods
Study Eligibility Criteria and Literature Search
A search of PubMed was developed and conducted by a
reference librarian looking for English language studies occurring
between the years of 1968–2010 using the following search terms:
interval training, VO2max, interval exercise + high/low intensity,
maximum O2, maximum/maximal VO2, maximal oxygen con-
sumption, peak oxygen uptake, maximal aerobic capacity, and the
following limits: humans, English. The primary author of each
eligible study was searched for in PubMed using the authors name
and the search term: exercise. Searches were also run on other
authors known by the investigators to have published papers that
used a combination of interval and continuous training. The
references of all eligible studies were also reviewed to identify other
potentially eligible studies that might have been missed using the
approaches outlined above. Subsequently, these studies were
searched for in PubMed using the specific authors and article
reference titles. Only published material was used. Figure 1 is a
schematic of our search strategy.
In order to be considered eligible for inclusion, studies had to
meet the following criteria:
1) Studies had to include a minimum of 3 subjects.
2) All subjects were previously healthy and between 18–45 years
of age.
3) The initial fitness level of the subjects had to fall within the
range of untrained/sedentary to recreationally active, defined
as 55 ml ? kg21 ? min21 or lower for men and 49.5 ml ? kg21 ?
min21 or lower for women. Studies were included with
recreationally trained individuals if they were in the minority
and if individual data was reported, allowing us to recalculate
the pre and post training VO2max values and their associated
SDs without the trained individuals. When VO2max was not
provided in ml ? kg21 ? min21 a group estimate was calculated
using the mean weight and pre VO2max in L ? min21.
4) Subjects had to train a minimum of 3 days per week for 6–
13 weeks. At least two, and preferably three, training sessions
had to be interval training.
5) Subjects had to be trained on either a cycle ergometer or by
running with a minimum work: relief ratio of 1 min on:1 min
off.
6) During each interval training session subjects had to have a
minimum cumulative time of 10 minutes at high intensity.
Due to the heterogeneity of training programs in the various
studies we felt it was critical for the ‘‘work’’ period of the
exercise sessions to be at intensities that were likely at least 80–
85% of VO2max or higher. In some studies the desired
intensities were set and monitored rigorously via power output
or heart rate and in some cases the authors had to make a
reasoned estimate. This was especially the case with some of
the running training studies that used timed runs (for example
reference 23).
7) Results had to be reported in pre and post mean VO2max
values 6 SD or SE, as ranges of change, or individual data.
8) Subjects could not be engaged in high intensity training before
the start of the study.
Study Selection
Two independent investigators (M.J.J and A.B.) screened the
titles and abstracts of all studies identified by the various search
methodologies to determine their potential eligibility. Studies that
did not have an abstract, along with studies that were deemed
potentially eligible, had their full text reviewed in order to
determine if they met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-
analysis. In order to avoid double counting of studies that reported
different aspects of the physiological responses to training, the

study design (training methodology, number of subjects, study
duration) and subject characteristics (age, pre and post VO2max)
of all accepted studies were compared. When studies with
common authors, study design, and subject characteristics were
found, the study with the larger number of subjects was used. This
was done because it appeared that some training studies generated
multiple publications with, for example, cardiorespiratory data the
focus of one paper, and the metabolic adaptations to training the
focus of a second paper.
Data Extraction and Synthesis
Data extraction was performed by one investigator (A.B.) who
used a standardized form that allowed for the extraction of study
characteristics (author, title, number of subjects, study duration,
age range, work: relief ratio, frequency of training, mean pre and
post training VO2max values in L ? min21 and in ml ? kg21 ?
min21 along with the associated standard errors of the mean
(SEM) and standard deviations (SD)).
When needed, pre and post VO2max values, along with pre and
post SD values, were converted into L N min21 to limit the
potentially confounding effects of changes in body weight that
might have occurred with training. Pre and post SEM values were
converted into SD. The calculated values were included in the
data extraction sheet. For several studies mean, SD, and pre post
correlation were recalculated from individual data. In the majority
of studies, only the pre and post measurements were reported (i.e.,
the standard deviation of the change or the correlation of the pre
and post measurements were not reported). Accordingly, the
correlation was conservatively set at 0.5 for these cases. When
studies reported treadmill and cycle VO2max values, the treadmill
values were used.
Summary measures
The principle summary measure utilized was group difference
in pre and post training means for VO2max expressed in L N
min21, calculated with a 95% confidence interval using a random
effects model [44]. As a sensitivity analysis to the random effects
model, a fixed effects model was also fit to the data to estimate the
degree of heterogeneity, indicated by I2. We used L N min21 to
avoid the potential confounding effect of significant weight loss
and to better compare our analysis with the data from Bouchard
et al. [5]. Mean difference was employed as it allowed us to
calculate the effect size, which was then compared to the effect size
of Bouchard et al. [5]. A standardized change in VO2max (mean
change for each study divided by the standard deviation of change)
was also analyzed using the same random effects modeling
framework.
In order to evaluate the possibility of publication bias, a funnel
plot of the mean differences was constructed and assessed. The
funnel plot (Figure 2) indicated the potential for publication bias
(e.g., smaller studies had larger effect sizes reported), so an
imputed model was considered with fictional studies representing
the complementary effect sizes to observed studies. A ‘Trim and
Fill’ analysis was conducted to further assess for publication bias by
providing an estimated pooled effect with the imputed studies
while ‘trimming’ (removing) the most extreme small studies [45].
Comprehensive Meta Analysis Software (Biostat) version 2.2.064
was used for all analyses.
Figure 2. Funnel plot of standard errors observed for the reported articles by the reported difference in means. The open circles are
observed studies whereas the solid circles are imputed studies to assess the role of publication on the estimated effect. The two estimates, denoted
by the open and filled diamonds for the observed and imputed studies, respectively, agree qualitatively with one another suggesting that the
findings may be robust in the presence of publication bias.

Results
Study Characteristics
A total of 211 articles were identified in the initial search. After
screening titles and abstracts, 181 articles were discarded as it was
apparent that they did not meet the study criteria. Figure 1 is a
schematic of our search strategy and displays the criteria for
exclusion. The full text of the remaining 30 articles was examined
in detail. An additional 70 articles were identified through
reference searches. The systematic review resulted in 37 articles
for
the
Meta-analysis.
Within
these
37
articles
were
334
participants (120 women) and 40 unique training groups (i.e.,
three articles each contained the results of two training programs).
In brief, all studies contained between 3 to 19 healthy subjects with
an age range of 18 to 42 years and pre training VO2max values
ranging from ,26 to 52 ml ? kg21 ? min21.
All subjects trained between 6 and 12 weeks using running,
cycling, or a combination of the two modalities with a work relief
ratio between 1:1 and 5:2. In all but six studies [10,14,15,17,32,38]
it was readily apparent that the subjects had trained at high
intensity for 10 minutes or more. Knuttgen and Overend reported
their work: relief ratios and the duration of their interval training,
which allowed us to estimate the number of intervals performed
and the time spent performing high intensity exercise which was
determined to be greater than 10 minutes [15,32]. Slordahl
reported the duration of their interval training but reported their
work: relief ratios as a range [38]. This allowed us to roughly
estimate that the subjects performed at least 10 minutes of work at
high intensity. Burke reported that their subjects trained to
exhaustion; therefore it was assumed that they performed at least
10 minutes of work at high intensity [17. Warburton reported that
their subjects performed interval training until the amount of work
performed equaled the amount of work that would have been
performed by the subject if they had been performing continuous
training [14]. Since the subjects in the continuous training group
worked for 30–48 min/day at 64.363.7% of their VO2max we
assumed that the subjects performing interval training worked for
at least 10 minutes at high intensity. Finally, Roca reported that
their subjects trained less than 10 minutes at high intensity on one
day of their high intensity training. Additionally, this was the only
study in which interval training did not account for at least half of
all training days for the test subjects. However, this exception was
justified because the continuous component was judged to be
strenuous enough to make up for the diminished interval
component [10].
Physiological Responses: Meta-Analysis Results
As a result of the training programs, VO2max increased
(p,0.001). The estimated mean change in VO2max over the
training programs using the random effects model was 0.51 L ?
min21 (95% CI: 0.43 to 0.60 L ? min21) (Figure 2). In terms of
standardized effect sizes (estimate divided by standard deviation),
the change in VO2max was 0.86 SDs (95% CI: 0.72 to 0.99 SDs).
Figure 3. Forest plot for the synthesis of 37 articles (40 trained cohorts) identified in the systematic review. The estimates reported for
each study are the means and 95% confidence intervals for the change in VO2max in L ? min21. The summary diamonds at the bottom of the plot
represent the summarized effects using fixed and random effects models, where the random effects estimates are considered the primary findings for
this study due to heterogeneity (I2 = 70). The estimated increase in VO2max as a result of interval training was 0.51 L ? min21 (95% CI: 0.43 to 0.60 L ?
min21; p,0.001).

There was some indication of publication bias in the funnel plot
(Figure 2). Specifically, the estimated effect using the ‘Trim and
Fill’ approach was 0.37 L ? min21 (95% CI: 0.28 to 0.46 L ?
min21), but the number of negative studies required to overturn
the observed finding was estimated to be over 4000 (Rosenthal’s
fail-safe N = 4531) [46]. Thus, while Figure 2 shows a slight
attenuation of the result with hypothetical studies imputed to
account for potential publication bias, the results are not
meaningfully changed. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was also
conducted under a fixed effects model. There was significant
heterogeneity in the exercise groups (I2 = 70), but the results of this
analysis agreed qualitatively with the primary random effects
model. Specifically, under the fixed effects model, the estimated
change was 0.45 L ? min21 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.49 L ? min21;
p,0.001).
To better illustrate the distribution of effects observed through
the systematic review and demonstrated in Figure 3, a weighted
histogram and density plot of the observed effects was created
(Figure 4). Each of the 40 observations included in the analysis was
weighted by the sample size to produce the distribution.
In a supplemental analysis, we also evaluated the nine studies
that reported the largest [7–15] and nine studies that reported the
smallest [17,23,30,32,33,37,41–43] mean changes in VO2max.
These studies are the ones that would be located in the tails of the
empirical distribution. Specifically, the mean 6 SD increase in
VO2max was 0.2760.05 vs 0.8760.15 L ? min21 (p,0.001) in
this
comparison.
Weeks
of
training
(6.961.4 vs
9.761.8;
p = 0.004),
duration
per
week
(123667 vs
209690 min;
p = 0.06), and the duration of the intervals for the entire study
(4796246 vs 6966264 min; p = 0.12) showed general patterns
that suggested the nine studies showing the smallest increases in
VO2max were of shorter duration in terms of both weekly training
and number of weeks. They also appear to have been less intense
(fewer total high intensity minutes) than the nine studies showing
the largest increases, although statistical significance was not
achieved for all comparisons. Finally, many of the interval training
studies reporting large increases in VO2max also used longer (3–
5 min) duration intervals.
Discussion
The main finding of this meta-analysis is that interval training
produces improvements in VO2max slightly greater than those
typically reported with what might be described as adult fitness
based continuous training even though many of the studies were of
short duration with limited training sessions per week. While the
observation that more intense training results in greater increases
in cardiorespiratory fitness is not surprising, our analysis suggests
that longer intervals combined with high intensity continuous
training can generate marked increases in VO2max in almost all
relatively young adults.
As noted in the introduction, the Heritage Study demonstrated
a mean increase in VO2max of 0.4 L ? min21 in response to
20 weeks of standardized adult fitness style training and marked
individual variation was observed [5]. This value is also relatively
high in comparison to other large adult fitness style training
programs that show increases in VO2max on the order of 0.2–
0.3 L N min21 [47]. By contrast, the studies we evaluated that used
interval training alone or in combination with continuous training
estimated a mean increase in VO2max of 0.5 L ? min21. Figure 4
demonstrates an estimated distribution of training evoked changes
in VO2max for the studies we evaluated. This figure presents a
distribution of means whereas the Heritage data is of population
values. It is worth noting, however, that the distribution of study
effects presented in Figure 4 would appear to be shifted right in
comparison to the Heritage data in spite of the fact that some of
the studies were of limited duration (6–8 weeks); used intervals that
were only one minute long and the time spent during the ‘‘work’’
portion of the interval training session was as low as 10 minutes.
Thus, assuming the individual subject data used to generate the
summary statistics in this meta-analysis follow roughly a normal
distribution, the distribution of individual changes would be
comparable, if not slightly better, than the Heritage data even
though the overall duration (weeks spent training) were shorter in
the studies we evaluated.
The conventional wisdom is that intervals of 3–5 minutes are
especially effective in evoking increases in exercise capacity.
Consistent with this idea, the nine studies that generated the
biggest increases in VO2max (,0.85/min) generally used intervals
of 3–5 minutes and high intensity continuous training [7–15].
Additionally, many of these studies presented either individual
data or ranges for VO2max values pre and post training, and
inspection of this data suggests that a marked training response
was seen in all subjects. Thus, given the large increases in VO2max
seen in these studies, we believe that caution must be used in
concluding that at least some humans are incapable (perhaps for
genetic reasons) of increasing their VO2max in response to
endurance exercise training.
Along these lines, many of the studies showing the largest
increases in VO2max appeared to follow a pattern similar to the
so-called ‘‘Hickson protocol’’ [7]. This protocol includes 10 weeks
of training 6 days/week with interval and continuous training on
alternate days. Interval training consists of six 5 minute sessions on
a cycle ergometer at a work rate approaching the subjects’
VO2max. These work periods are separated by 2 minutes of active
rest. As the subjects’ power output increases during training, the
exercise intensity is increased as needed. On the non-interval days,
continuous training consists of running as fast as possible for
30 min/day during the 1st week, 35 min/day during the second
week, and 40 min/day or longer thereafter.
The original study of Hickson and colleagues noted that
VO2max was continuing to increase at the end of the 10 week
training program [7]. However, their subjects declined to continue
to train due to the extremely arduous nature of the program. This

effects of interval training on VO2max. Each of the 40
observations included in the analysis was weighted by the sample size
to produce the distribution with the estimate of the percent of subjects
with a given effect size noted on the Y axis.

observation emphasizes that it may be unrealistic to expect
significant segments of the population to participate in an exercise
training program that permits them to reach their individual upper
limit for VO2max. It should also be noted that the high intensity
continuous running almost certainly contributed to the large
increases in VO2max seen in studies using the Hickson protocol
but it is not possible to determine the relative role of each type of
training.
Since there is no genetic data on the subjects from the studies
included in our analysis it is not possible to use them to
retrospectively evaluate the genetic determinants of trainability
that have emerged from Heritage [5]. It is well accepted that the
increases in VO2max with training are due to increases in cardiac
output and peripheral oxygen extraction. However, the contribu-
tion of changes in stroke volume, blood volume, capillary density,
muscle mitochondrial content and many other factors associated
with training induced increases in VO2max might vary on both an
individual basis and perhaps via interaction with specific elements
of a given training program [48–52].
In addition to the well-known limitations associated with
retrospective analysis of data reported previously, there are
specific limitations to our analysis. First, as detailed above there
was wide variability in training programs used in the studies we
evaluated. Second, about two thirds of the subjects included in the
studies we evaluated were (likely Caucasian) young men and this
could explain at least some of the increased responsiveness that we
saw. However, sex and age generally do not have major effects on
the VO2max responses to training [5,41]. We also did not include
studies in patient populations that have shown marked improve-
ments in exercise capacity with interval training in groups
previously thought to have limited trainability [53]. Nor did we
include a body of work showing that very short bouts of high
intensity exercise followed by longer periods of recovery can have
profound effects on exercise capacity [54]. The findings from these
studies along with the data reported in our paper indicate that
some of the peripheral metabolic adaptations to training require
can be elicited by very short periods of high intensity exercise, but
that longer intervals are required to see large changes in cardiac
output and VO2max. The analysis also suggested some effect of
publication bias, particularly with studies with small sample sizes
and small effects. While the estimated change in VO2max
remained statistically significant with various sensitivity analyses,
a clear causal association is inherently limited with this data.
In summary, our analysis indicates that in addition to studies
using training programs consistent with various public health
guidelines, the basic biology of trainability needs to be evaluated
using regimens designed to generate the most robust possible
physiological adaptations.
