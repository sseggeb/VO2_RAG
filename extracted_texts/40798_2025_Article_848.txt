Abstract 
Background  World-class coaches collect training data from their athletes systematically and exhibit an experimental 
mindset when making individual training adjustments in response to this data and other forms of feedback. However, 
the methods, expertise, and insights of highly accomplished endurance coaches is so far almost untouched in the sci-
entific literature. The aim of this study was to provide a synthesis of common features and sport-specific variations 
in best-practice training characteristics within Olympic endurance sports as described by world-class Norwegian 
coaches.
Methods  A multiple case-study design was used, and twelve successful male Norwegian coaches served as key 
informants. Together, they were responsible for athletes winning more than 380 international medals, representing 
long-distance running, biathlon, rowing, cross-country skiing, speed skating, road cycling, swimming, and triathlon. 
The study design included: (1) an extensive, email-administered and Word™-based questionnaire related to training 
characteristics at the macro-, meso-, micro-, and session-level; (2) cross-referencing data with historically reported 
training logs from successful athletes; (3) in-depth and semi-structured in-person interviews with each coach; (4) 
a review process among authors and coaches. The data collection was undertaken in 2022.
Results  All coaches adhere to a traditional periodization model, including a gradual shift towards lower overall train-
ing volume and more competition-specific training as the competitive period approaches. The coaches also employ 
a pragmatic approach to align training organization with the various constraints faced in the training process. Another 
common emerging feature was an emphasis on high volume of low-intensity training combined with 2–3 weekly 
“key workout” days consisting of 3–5 intensive training sessions. Finally, coaches across all sports focused on achieving 
high training quality by optimizing training sessions, systematically controlling the load-recovery balance, and ensur-
ing optimal preparations for major competitions. Substantial sport-specific differences were evident in terms of vol-
ume, frequency, intensity distribution, and application of strength and cross training, mainly due to variations in exer-
cise mode constraints (i.e., mechanical, and muscular loading), competition distance, and organizational aspects.
Conclusions  This study offers novel insights into best-practice training characteristics in Olympic endurance, shed-
ding light on both commonalities and sport-specific variations. These insights can be used to generate new hypoth-
eses to be further elucidated and contribute to the development of evidence-based training practices.

Background
Performance development in endurance sports chal-
lenges athletes to continuously strive to transcend their 
physical, technical, and psychological boundaries. This 
requires intricate harmonization of demanding sport-
specific workouts with the imperative of recovery to 
optimize adaptations and minimize the risk of maladap-
tation, burnout, and injury. Long-term training strate-
gies emerge from an interplay between evidence-based 
scientific knowledge and practical experience tailored 
to each sport’s unique demands, shaped by physiologi-
cal, social, and cultural influences. Accordingly, coaches 
must have a clear view of how they periodize and apply 
general training principles to achieve the highest possible 
quality in day-to-day training practice [1–3]. This frame-
work forms the basis for the more detailed training load 
programming, which builds on the coach’s interpretation 
of a complex interplay of training duration, intensity, fre-
quency, methods (e.g., intervals or continuous sessions), 
and modality [1–3].
While training practices have been extensively quan-
tified and described in world-class athletes in long-
distance running [4–11], road cycling [12–19], and 
cross-country skiing [20–26], more limited information 
is available regarding training in other endurance disci-
plines such as swimming, biathlon, speed skating, row-
ing, and triathlon [27–37]. Although traditional, block 
and other periodization models have existed for decades 
[2, 38–41], information regarding long-term training 
periodization in endurance sports remains scarce and 
equivocal. However, independent of training organiza-
tion, some of the main characteristics of the training pro-
cess observed among successful athletes seem common 
across endurance sports. This includes relatively high 
training volumes, dedicating approximately 80–90% of 
total training time to low-intensity endurance training 
(LIT), supplemented by 10–15% at moderate- (MIT) or 
high-intensity (HIT) and sport-specific variation in use 
of strength training, technical drills, and speed train-
ing [4, 19–22, 42]. Accepting these apparent universali-
ties, there are also significant sport-specific variations 
in competition duration, exercise modalities and bio-
mechanical constraints, leading to different energetic, 
mechanical, and muscular loads across endurance sports 
[43]. This variation helps explain how sport-specific 
training regimes have emerged. To date, valid compari-
sons of training variables across studies and sports have 
been challenging due to the absence of a common meth-
odological framework (e.g., intensity zones) and stand-
ardized terminology.
The scientific understanding of the endurance training 
process remains incomplete and largely relies on small-
sampled or case studies involving some of the world’s 
most prominent endurance athletes. These descrip-
tive investigations primarily use retrospective training 
data extracted from athletes’ training diaries, provid-
ing important insights into individual training charac-
teristics. However, the methods, expertise, and insights 
of highly accomplished coaches have received minimal 
attention in endurance training research literature thus 
far. Importantly, these coaches are often connected to 
specific athletes for years, or even their entire senior 
level career. This gap in information within the current 
literature highlights the need to gather complementary 
evidence from experienced coaches. In this context, our 
experience is that the best coaches employ a systematic 
approach in collecting training data and exhibit an exper-
imental mindset when making individual training adjust-
ments that is almost untouched in the scientific literature 
[44]. In addition to possessing a clear mental model of 
how to organize and implement the training process, suc-
cessful coaches and athletes often emphasize indicators 
of training quality as crucial factors for achieving suc-
cess [45, 46]. Therefore, elucidating and validating the 
long-standing wisdom of coaches who have achieved suc-
cess with multiple athletes would provide novel insights

into best-practice endurance training and generate new 
hypotheses to be tested in future experimental designs.
Norway has emerged as a prominent sports nation 
[47] in endurance sports. An additional advantage of the 
Norwegian endurance training, monitoring and testing 
system is the emergence and refinement of a uniform 
framework for defining training content across all endur-
ance sports, enabling valid comparisons across athletes 
and sports. Based on the combination of questionnaires, 
training data analyses and in-depth semi-structured 
interviews, the purpose of this study was to explore com-
mon features and sport-specific variations in best-prac-
tice training characteristics in Olympic endurance sports 
as described by world-class Norwegian coaches.
Methods
Study Design
This study was a part of a larger project investigating 
successful coaches in Olympic endurance sports. The 
present study focuses on their training practices at the 
annual, monthly and/or weekly level (i.e., macro-, meso- 
and micro-level, respectively), while training practices at 
the session level are presented in another study [48]. We 
used a descriptive multiple case study design focused on 
the phenomenon of best-practice training characteristics 
in Olympic endurance sports. The cases of long-distance 
running, biathlon, rowing, cross-country skiing, long-
track speed skating, road cycling, swimming, and tri-
athlon are included in the current study. To exclude the 
possible influence of “middle-distance” disciplines, which 
are present in most of the above-listed sports, we only 
included endurance disciplines with ≥ 6  min competi-
tion time. This corresponds to an aerobic energy contri-
bution of > 80% [49]. To allow for cross-comparisons and 
contrasts across sports, all cases were situated in Norway, 
assuming relatively similar culture, system and terminol-
ogy to plan, track and implement training. The data col-
lection was undertaken in 2022.
This study was grounded in an interpretivist episte-
mological perspective, aiming to generate insights and 
understanding rather than to generalize findings. Posi-
tioned within the research paradigm of pragmatism, our 
methodological approach provided both qualitative and 
quantitative data to illuminate the complexity and speci-
ficity of the phenomenon under investigation. Specifi-
cally, a combination of questionnaires, training diaries, 
and in-depth semi-structured interviews was used to col-
lect, revise, and refine study outcomes through an inter-
active process. The units of analysis were defined a priori, 
based on the conceptual frameworks of training science 
[50]: training organization, periodization, and content at 
the macro-, meso- and micro-level and training quality.
Participants
Twelve male Norwegian coaches, experienced with 
coaching of both female and male world-class athletes, 
participated in this project. They were all currently or 
previously responsible for the training of numerous 
world-class, mostly Norwegian endurance athletes who, 
in total, have won nearly 400 Olympic-, World-, and 
European-Championship medals. Two coaches were 
engaged in each sport for distance cross-country ski-
ing, biathlon, swimming, triathlon, and long-distance 
running, while one coach was engaged in each sport 
for speed skating, rowing, and road cycling. One coach 
was involved in both swimming and triathlon. Writ-
ten informed consent from all the coaches was obtained 
prior to the study, and all coaches approved the manu-
script prior to submission. The Regional Committee for 
Medical and Health Research Ethics waived the require-
ment for ethical approval, while the ethics of the pro-
ject was performed in accordance with the institutional 
requirements at the School of Health Sciences, Kristiania 
University of Applied Sciences. The Norwegian Centre 
for Research Data approved data security and handling 
(reference #605,672; 01.09.2023). The study was per-
formed according to ethical standards outlined in the 
Declaration of Helsinki.
Procedures
A pragmatic four-step procedure was used to collect 
comprehensive and complementary information on 
training characteristics across different endurance sports:
(1)	 Initially, a Word™-based questionnaire related 
to training characteristics at the macro-, meso-, 
micro-, and session-level was administered to all 
coaches by email. Specifically, the questionnaire 
(Online Appendix 1) focused on the following con-
tent: the organization and periodization of train-
ing across different phases and models, strategies 
for peaking, training content including volume, 
intensity, frequency, and various training forms 
and modes, as well as the processes used to achieve 
high quality of training. The questionnaire was spe-
cifically developed for the current purpose based 
on training theory, previous research [e.g., 1–42] 
and co-author experiences working within the elite 
sport system. The questionnaire was pilot tested by 
other researchers and coaches in various endurance 
sports and adapted based on their inputs.
(2)	 In the next step, the coaches were asked to cross-
reference the provided data with historically 
reported training logs from some of their most suc-
cessful athletes.

Sandbakk et al. Sports Medicine - Open           (2025) 11:45 
(3)	 Thereafter, in-depth semi-structured interviews 
(Online Appendix 2) were conducted with each 
coach by the first and second authors to obtain 
deeper insights and clarify the remaining details 
related to the information emerging in steps 1 and 
2. Each interview was performed in-person and 
lasted approximately 120–180 min, of which about 
two thirds were directly related to this study. The 
questions included the same topics as described for 
the questionnaire, but they were more openly for-
mulated. Each interview was audio-recorded, tran-
scribed, and approved by the interviewed coach. 
Formal translation and back-translation from 
Norwegian to English were performed with cross 
checks by native English and Norwegian speakers.
(4)	 Finally, we involved the coaches in a comprehensive 
two-way review and negotiation process to clarify 
and ensure that the findings presented reflected 
their 
perspectives 
on 
best-practice 
training 
characteristics in their respective sport as accurately 
as possible.
For aerobic endurance training intensity quantification, 
a six-zone scale was applied [48]. Moreover, a modified 
session goal approach to quantify training based on Sylta 
et al. [51] was employed. For speed, drills and strength 
training, time from start to end of this part of the session 
was recorded. For this study, cross-training was defined 
as endurance training in a non-specific mode. Treadmill 
running (including anti-gravity treadmill running), roller 
skiing, roller skating, ergometer rowing and indoor 
cycling were considered specific (i.e., not cross-training) 
for runners, cross-country skiers/biathletes, speed 
skaters, rowers and cyclists, respectively.
Analyses
Numerical information based on the questionnaire was 
systematized in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, 
Redmond, WA, USA). This included typical range in 
annual training time and number of sessions, time 
distribution across different training forms, exercise 
modalities and intensity zones, the amount and type 
of intensive sessions, as well as typical weekly training 
volume, training within intensity zones and exercise 
modalities for typical high-load training weeks in the 
preparation period and training weeks during the 
competitive period. Thereafter, the coaches cross-
referenced the provided data with historically reported 
training logs from some of their most successful athletes. 
Here, they were told to check that their reported 
numbers matched “best-practice” among successful 
athletes, and that they should do modifications in cases 
where they found mismatch between own reporting and 
successful athletes’ actual training. Finally, the authors 
ensured mutual understanding and that the preliminary 
findings reflected the coaches’ perspectives on best-
practice training characteristics in their respective sport 
as accurately as possible during the interviews.
For qualitative information on (a) commonalities 
across endurance sports and (b) sport-specific features 
in training organization and periodization, training 
content and training quality, the questionnaires served 
as an initial reflection process for the coaches, while the 
follow-up interviews allowed them to provide deeper 
insights. A systematic six-step procedure inspired by 
reflexive thematic analysis as proposed by Braun and 
Clarke [52] was used to analyze the interview transcripts. 
Step one involved familiarization with the material and 
initial discussions among all authors. Then, raw themes 
were identified by level 1 and level 2 coding procedures 
(step 2) and organized into three main themes by the 
first and last author (step 3). The revision of themes 
and validation against the interviews (step 4) were the 
result of discussions and negotiations among authors. 
Additionally, a comprehensive structured negotiation 
process between researchers and coaches was carried out 
to assure quality and practical relevance of findings. In 
the final definition of themes (step 5), contextualization 
with previous literature on training science was 
addressed. Ultimately, all authors collectively contributed 
to crafting the final manuscript (step 6).
Results
Training Organization and Periodization
Coaches across all sports reported that they plan 
according 
to 
a 
traditional 
periodization 
model 
(Tables 1 and 2) with gliding shifts in volume, intensity 
distribution, and use of training forms and modalities 
observed across phases in most sports. However, within 
this framework, periodization was done pragmatically to 
meet various constraints, such as competition schedule, 
altitude camps, access to facilities and snow/ice/water 
etc. In addition to the quotes provided in Table 1, this is 
exemplified by the following statements:
Coach 1: Annual planning begins with creating a 
competition plan, working backward from the most 
important competition of the year, which is the 
Olympics or World Championships. The year is then 
divided into macro-, meso-, and micro-cycles before 
I begin the program planning. The plans are based 
on the performance requirements of the main event 
and the athlete’s capacity. When planning the train-
ing, I apply the fundamental training principles, as 
well as principles and guidelines from traditional 
periodization. This means that I progress from gen-

Table 1  Commonalities in training organization and periodization, training content and training quality by successful Norwegian 
endurance coaches across different sports
Common features
Example of coach statement
Traditional periodization model with early emphasis on high training 
volume and gradual shift towards reduced volume, higher training 
intensity and increased specificity of key sessions as the competition 
period approaches
Coach 3: Training is built up in line with traditional periodization, with a focus 
on high volume. As the championships approach, intensity and specificity 
increase, while volume gradually decreases
Coach 7: We increase volume first, before focusing gradually more on sport-
specific high-intensity sessions. Consequently, the easy training must be easier, 
and we must have good control over the total load. Still, we have a pragmatic 
approach to periodization and fit training to the various challenges met along 
the way, such as competitions, camps and struggles the athletes meet along 
the way
Three weekly “hard days” with 3–5 key workouts such as interval sessions, 
competitions, or progressive long-distance sessions
Coach 12: In most parts of the preparation period, we conduct 4–5 intensive 
sessions around the lactate threshold. These sessions mainly occur on Tuesday, 
Thursday, and Saturday, with double threshold sessions on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays
Coach 5: During the preparation period, I typically plan for three heavy training 
days per week. These days involve a high volume of work, with two of them 
including double threshold sessions. This approach provides a significant 
specific load on both technique and the aerobic energy system
High-volume approach, with 85–95% of total training devoted to aerobic 
endurance training and 80–90% of this dedicated to low-intensity 
endurance training
Coach 4: Although considerable strength and power is required in rowing, 
training consists of 85% aerobic endurance training, in which 90% is performed 
at low intensity
Coach 2: The training primarily consists of aerobic workouts, with 15% of the 
sessions performed as threshold training. The remaining sessions are conducted 
at low intensity. Additionally, some strength training is included to prevent 
injuries
Low focus on anaerobic/supra-maximal training but sport-specific 
strength and speed training depending on competitive demands
Coach 8: Anaerobic training is not or very seldom performed in triathlon, as this 
is not a crucial performance-determinant in the sport
Coach 1: We have some specific anaerobic sessions in the last weeks before 
the important competitions. However, we do systematic speed and strength 
training throughout the entire preparation period and maintain these qualities 
during the competitive period
Optimization of key training sessions through goal setting, physical, 
technical, and mental preparation, intensity control and coach presence
Coach 1: It is not sufficient to just perform training according to the plan, but 
the best athletes continuously strive to perform these sessions according to its 
purpose, by controlling intensity, searching for good technical solutions, and 
being mentally at a good place. This is what differentiates the best from the rest
Coach 3: For us, each session has a clear goal, and we strive to perform the 
session as close as possible to this goal. We briefly discuss this after the sessions 
to assure we learn from the execution
Balancing training load and recovery to provide optimal conditions 
for adaptations through thorough documentation of training 
and recovery routines, regular testing, and close coach-athlete dialogue
Coach 7: I am skeptical when coaches and athletes say that they are training 
on the edge of what they tolerate. We should not aim to have as high training 
load as possible, but instead try to find a load-recovery balance that enables 
sustainability and best possible outcome over time. Controlling this balance 
carefully and not taking too large short-term risks with high loads are 
important, and this strategy also leads to higher accumulated training loads 
over time
Coach 10: We train in a laboratory, where we continuously monitor both 
internal and external intensity. Additionally, we see and talk to the athlete every 
day. This close interaction provides a unique opportunity to adjust the daily 
training load
Preparing for peak performance during the most important competitions 
by purposefully developing physical, technical, and mental capacities 
throughout the year
Coach 11: All the conducted training during the year should build up the 
athletes’ physical, technical, and mental foundation for best performance in the 
most important competitions. That is the purpose of each training session and 
the entire training process, and every session should have a specific purpose on 
the road towards that goal
Coach 3: For the swimmer to perform well in championships, we must think 
holistically. Therefore, in every session, we focus on the physical, technical, and 
mental aspects. My role is to challenge each athlete individually based on their 
greatest needs

eral to specific training and increase the training vol-
ume before raising the intensity.
Coach 12: Three to four times a year, we perform 
altitude training camps with slightly increased 
training volume. However, the training both at 
altitude and in the low-land is conducted in 
accordance with the guidelines from traditional 
periodization.
Coach 3: The basis for annual planning is Matveyev’s 
periodization with macro-, meso- and micro-
cycles. During the year, we have three macro-cycles 
(competition periods), each with corresponding 
meso- and micro-cycles. We start with general 
training and progress to more intensive and specific 
training.
As part of the pragmatic approach, some training 
blocks emphasizing specific physiological or technical 
components were applied in certain parts of the training 
year in some sports. For example, ~ 1-week or 3-week 
blocks with high density of competitions are performed 
during stage races in professional road cycling. Moreover, 
specific exercise mode-focused blocks are applied for 
speed skating and skiing sports during summer/autumn 
training camps. In addition, most coaches incorporate 
altitude training camps > 1500  m above sea level into 
the program (Fig. 1 and Table 2), and these are normally 
periodized as blocks of high-volume training where less 
intensive training is performed. Except for speed skating, 
where the coach did not incorporate altitude training 
systematically, all the other interviewed coaches reported 
individualized altitude training regimes normally totaling 
50–100  days of altitude exposure per year. This is 
exemplified by the following statements:
Coach 1: Altitude training is a central part of 
the development philosophy and consists of 3-4 
altitude camps, each lasting around three weeks. 
The first altitude camp takes place early in the first 
macrocycle, allowing us to focus on a lot of low-
intensity training, as well as good recovery routines 
and intensity management. The remaining altitude 
camps are evenly distributed throughout the year 
and optimally timed in relation to the World 
Championships or Olympics, where the athlete 
needs to be in peak condition.
Coach 9: The only times we use block periodization 
are in connection with altitude training and 
competition periods such as championships, or when 
competitions are very close together. In this way, 
traditional periodization forms the basis for our 
annual periodization.
Coach 4: When we aim to achieve significant 
development in a particular skill, we block the 
training. We do this, for instance, at the beginning of 
the training year, where we often prioritize strength 
training and muscle mass increase. We also do 
the same for intensive training when the season 
approaches.
Coach 11: Whenever we have access to ice during the 
preparation period, ice skating training is prioritized 
100%. In these times, cycling training is only used 
for warm-up and cool-down. During these short 
periods, the focus is on keeping the load low on other 
types of training so that we can get the maximum 
benefit from the ice time.
Coach 8: Altitude training is a central part of the 
training philosophy. At altitude, we prioritize a large 
volume of I-1 and I-3 training, followed by intensive 
training and competitions after altitude camps.

Figure  1 shows considerable variation in seasonal 
structure across endurance sports. Although coaches 
in most sports apply single periodization where the 
competition period typically lasts 3–4  months, other 
sports have a more complex competition schedule. For 
example, road cyclists have a very long competition 
period (approximately eight months), making it necessary 
to interject shorter periods of preparation training within 
the long competition season:
Coach 6: We first set the competition plan for the 
rider and try to implement preparation training for 
2-3 weeks also within the competition period. These 
are important to complement the competitive load 
and maintain capacities throughout the season.
In connection with tapering, coaches across all sports 
highlight that training frequency is maintained while the 
duration of sessions becomes shorter at all intensities. 
The purpose of these periods is to maintain the sport-
specific physical capacities while building preparedness 
and optimizing mental, technical and tactical skills. This 
is exemplified by the following statements:
Coach 10: Peaking is quite simple. The goal is to 
recover while maintaining the capacity that has 
been built up during training. This is achieved by 
maintaining the frequency of all intensities more 
or less as usual but cutting the duration of each 
session in half. Additionally, all strength training is 
eliminated. About every other day, we conduct short, 
intensive sessions using short intervals. This allows 
us to train at competition speed, which is important 
for fine-tuning technique and ensuring that the 
swimmer is in the best possible position for optimal 
pacing.
Coach 2: To achieve peak performance in important 
competitions, we normally have a good training 
period of 2-3 weeks with increased training load, 
followed by 10 days of reduced training load, 
especially through reduced duration of sessions, but 
maintained or slightly increased intensity although 
intensive sessions are also shorter.
As described in Table 2 and the following quotes, there 
are relatively large differences in the micro-periodization 
across sports.
Coach 12: The training load is relatively consistent 
throughout the preparation period. Once we reach 
160-180 km of running per week, we maintain that 
level with relatively small adjustments. The excep-
tion can be at altitude, where the pace is slightly 
lower, and the volume can be up to 200 km per week.
Coach 7: To prevent injuries and illnesses, we always 
implement a recovery week every 3rd or 4th training 
week. During these weeks, the load is reduced by 
having fewer training sessions, fewer training hours, 
and shorter or fewer intensive sessions.
Coach 4: Training weeks with reduced load are 
systematically implemented during the preparation 
period. Every 3rd or 4th week, the load is reduced 
in line with Olympiatoppen’s philosophy: 1-2 fewer 
training sessions and a 25-35% reduction in training 
hours. This is done consistently, but individual 
adjustments are also made.
Coach 11: When we train up to 30 hours during 
the preparation period, it is important to prevent 
injuries and illnesses. Every third or fourth week, 
the training load is drastically reduced, mainly 
by shortening each session, but also by allowing 
ourselves a day off.
Coach 8: We train with a high load almost every 
week. It is mainly in connection with travel to and 
from camps and competitions that the training 
load is slightly lower than usual. In this regard, the 
fluctuations in our training are less compared to 
what is typical in other sports.
Coach 3: The rhythm of the load is a central part of 
my training philosophy. Being able to vary the load 
is probably the best way to manage performance 
development as well as preventing injuries and 
illnesses. During recovery weeks, I reduce both 
intensity, duration, and frequency. These weeks are 
important for both the physical and mental aspects 
of a long-term training process.
Coaches in most of the examined sports recommend 
three days with intensive sessions (i.e., MIT and HIT) 
spread out over the week (see typical quotes in Table 1). 
Importantly, training sessions performed in intensity 
zones 3, 4, or 5 were viewed to all be “intensive” sessions. 
About half of the coaches (representing long-distance 
running, rowing, speed skating, swimming, and triathlon) 
recommend two intensive sessions in some of these hard 
training days (most often zone 3, so called “threshold” 
intensity sessions), with the purpose to increase the 
overall volume of intensive training in a manageable way 
that allowed adequate recovery. This is exemplified by the 
following statements:
Coach 5: Double-threshold sessions are a central 
part of my training philosophy. During the 
preparation period, we typically perform double-
threshold sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This 
includes long intervals in the morning and shorter 

Page 9 of 23
Sandbakk et al. Sports Medicine - Open           (2025) 11:45 
	
intervals in the afternoon. Organizing training this 
way allows us to increase the volume of work around 
the anaerobic threshold, with relatively low injury 
risk, as the shorter sessions are most often performed 
on a treadmill or graveled surface.
Coach 11: During the preparation period, it’s 
common for us to conduct two intensive sessions on 
a training day, once or twice a week. The purpose 
is to increase the volume of intensive and specific 
training. Double sessions on the bike usually consist 
of long threshold sessions lasting about 60 minutes. 
We also use double intensive sessions on skates, 
though to a much lesser extent. These sessions are 
primarily conducted in intensity zones 4, 5, and 6, as 
the goal is to maximize the distance at 5000 m and 
10,000 m pace.
Training Content
As illustrated in Fig. 2 and Tables 3 and  4, coaches across 
all sports employ a high-volume approach, with annual 
training hours depending on the sport-specific con-
straints and requirements, ranging from ~ 600 h for dis-
tance running to ~ 1400 h for triathlon. The sport-specific 
training features detailed in Table  3 indicates that the 
most important factors underlying sport-specific differ-
ences in total training volume and the amount of train-
ing performed in specific modalities are primarily due 
to variations in mechanical and muscular loading, while 
the competition distance may play an additional role. 
In addition, some sports have limited access to specific 
training facilities/conditions, such as training on snow, 
ice, or indoor pools, influencing the amount of specific 
training performed.
In all sports, most of the total training time (85–95%) 
is devoted to aerobic endurance training, in which a 
significant portion of this (80–90%) is dedicated to LIT 
(zones 1–2) (Fig.  2 and Table  4). In general, most LIT 
is performed as continuous work in zone 1. Although 
sessions prescribed to be performed mainly in zone-2 
rarely occur, a certain amount of time in zone 2 is 
performed as part of sessions aimed to be performed 
in zone-1 in many of the sports (Table 3). For example, 
relatively short LIT sessions (i.e., less than 60  min) in 
running allows more time in zone 2 without too much 
accumulated strain. Moreover, the speed required to ski 
with an effective technique during uphill terrain may lead 
skiers into zone 2, and that obtaining sufficient power per 
stroke when rowing requires training in this zone. In road 
cycling, the many hours in competitions and low-cadence 
training leads to a certain amount of time spent in zone 2. 
The importance of large amounts of LIT is exemplified by 
the following statements:
Coach 6: High volume at low intensity is one of the 
main principles of my training philosophy. To train 
enough hours, the majority of endurance training 
must be performed at low intensity, using a varied 
mix of running, cycling, roller skiing, and skiing. This 
approach helps develop good technique and aerobic 
capacity. However, it is important to emphasize that 
the goal is not the highest possible volume, but a 
volume that the athlete can actually benefit from.
Coach 7: Easy training should be kept easy, so the 
athlete is as well-prepared as possible for interval 
sessions. We are therefore meticulous about ensuring 
that I-zone 1 training is done at the lower end of 
I-zone 1. We are especially careful about this in 
running and cycling training during the preparation 
period.
Coach 9: The best way to control intensity is to 
choose terrain that facilitates training in the desired 
zone. To maintain rhythm and flow during I-zone 1 
sessions, the terrain should be relatively gentle, so the 
heart rate does not get too high. However, to preserve 
technique and flow in ski sessions, it is acceptable to 
reach a heart rate in the lower part of I-zone 2 when 
going uphill.
Coach 10: In swimming, we use interval training 
across all intensity zones, including zone 1 and 
2. This is largely due to organizational reasons, 
as well as to give the swimmers the opportunity to 
drink and receive feedback from me or other support 
staff. Pure continuous sessions are rarely used, but 
I always challenge them by using long sub-distances 
or by making the breaks very brief.
For most sports, the large amount of LIT is com-
bined with 2–3 intensive days per week. In total, these 
intensive days consist of 2–5 key sessions in zones 3–5 
(Fig. 2 and Table 4). However, this pattern may change 
slightly in the competition periods, especially in sports 
with high competition density. In all sports, there is a 
relatively large distribution of intensive time in zone 
3. However, in some of the examined sports, espe-
cially long distance running and swimming, some of 
the “zone-3 sessions” are designed as short-to-medium 
long work intervals with short recovery periods, ena-
bling metabolic markers (for example blood lactate and 
heart rate values) to stay within the defined “thresh-
old” zone, while speed or power is markedly higher, 
approaching values normally used in zones 4–5. For 
all sports, the transition from the preparation to com-
petition period is marked by a gradual change towards 
lower total training volumes and more training in zones 
4–5 (Table 4). However, coaches in all examined sports 
highlight that most of zone 4–5 sessions are performed

in a controlled manner and not to exhaustion. While 
the number of hard days is relatively similar across 
sports, there are significant sport-specific differences 
in both the number of distinct intensive sessions and 
the relative emphasis of zone 3, 4 and 5 across sports. 
These discrepancies are explained by (1) sport-specific 
demands and (2) the use of exercise modes with differ-
ent mechanical loading (Table 3). This is exemplified by 
the following statements:
Coach 11: Skating training on ice is very demanding, 
as we work in deep positions. Therefore, speed skat-
ers can only handle 150-200 hours on ice per year. 
Table 3  Sport-specific features in the training described by world-class coaches across Olympic endurance sports
*The highlighted topics are based on concrete statements from the interviews and was prioritized by the group of researchers before they were validated by the 
coaches
Sports
Sport-specific features*
Long-distance running
Relatively short training sessions, especially for zones 1–3, are recommended due to the high mechanical load 
and increased risk of injuries
Running in zone 1 primarily focuses on the upper part of the zone, approaching zone 2
Most endurance training involves running, with cross-training serving as an alternative during rehabilitation 
or to prevent injury. To reduce the load and thereby prevent injuries, many running sessions are conducted 
on gravel roads and treadmills, while track sessions are usually limited to 1–2 weekly sessions during the preparation 
phase for then to be gradually increased towards the competition phase
Regularly, zone 3 sessions are designed in a way that makes metabolic markers stay within the zone, while speed 
is markedly higher, approaching zones 4–5
Cross-country skiing and Biathlon Training in zone 1 mostly occur in the lower part of zone 1, especially during running sessions
Skiing primarily take place in the lower and middle part of zone 1, occasionally drifting into zone 2 during uphill 
sections to maintain good technique
Endurance sessions on roller skis (and skis) during the preparation period are supplemented by running 
with and without poles on soft surfaces
Specific interval sessions are performed on roller skis/skis on varying terrain similar to competitions, often combined 
with shooting in biathlon
Rowing
Rowing includes significant amounts of cross-training. More specifically, high volumes of cycling is used in zone 
1 as well as for warm-up and cool-down before rowing sessions. Classical skiing is prioritized in winter months 
when rowing on water is restricted to training camps abroad
The high power-demands in rowing requires regular strength training, and speed training is usually performed 
specifically at the end of low-intensity rowing sessions or in combination with interval sessions
Speed skating
Speed skating involves only 150–200 h of specific training per year due to the high muscular load/strain, making 
it challenging to train at low intensity. Thus, speed skating sessions primarily occur in zone 4–5 and as anaerobic 
endurance training
There is no access to ice in Norway from April to August. Training in zones 1–3 mainly consists of cycling, 
with occasional sessions on skates and inline skates. Imitation drills and dry land training is performed during this 
period
Road cycling
Road cycling primarily involves one long daily session lasting 3–6 h, but such sessions incorporate intensive training 
and sprint training. Thus, the intensive training has a different structure than what is common in other endurance 
sports
Much of the intense training occurs during cycling races (competitions), with approximately 50–70 race days 
per year. The intensity in races varies depending on the type of race and the rider’s role in the team
Swimming
Interval training is utilized across all intensities, from zone 1 to zone 5 as well as anaerobic endurance training, 
with continuous work rarely being performed
Short rest intervals in zones 1 and 2 are included for practical/organizational reasons, allowing swimmers to ingest 
fluids/nutrition during long workouts and to avoid monotony
Regularly, zone 3 sessions are designed in a way that makes metabolic markers stay within the zone, while speed 
is markedly higher, approaching zones 4
Training above zone 3 predominantly uses the crawl technique, while other swimming strokes are primarily 
employed in zone 1 and zone 2, comprising no more than 30–40% of the total swimming distance
Various drill exercises and special equipment are employed to enhance speed, power development, and reduce 
the load
Triathlon
Triathlon combines swimming, cycling, and running, in which training sessions are executed separately 
in these modes, targeting the specific demands of each mode, and as combination sessions where transitions 
between the disciplines are trained specifically (so-called BRICK sessions)
Although many of the training principles mentioned above for swimming, cycling, and running also apply 
to triathlon, triathletes train less in each of these disciplines and prioritize sessions according to the sub-disciplines’ 
specific role in competitions
The relatively short swimming part, with a fast start to get a good position early, and the technical limitations 
of triathletes compared to swimmers, lead to less zone 1–3 training while zone 4–5 is prioritized
In cycling and running, the training patterns are relatively similar to specialists, although the training duration, 
especially at Zone 1–2, is lower for triathletes

These hours are used carefully, meaning the majority 
of this training is done in I-zones 4, 5, and 6. Train-
ing in other I-zones is used as progressive warm-up 
or as acclimatization to ice training at the start of 
the training year.
Coach 5: 60-70% of all threshold sessions are done 
using 1000 m and 2000 m intervals. To develop 
running technique and capacity in a manageable 
way, we regularly conduct short interval sessions, 
often consisting of 20 x 400 meters with short breaks. 
The purpose of these sessions is to allow running 
intervals at a higher speed but with lactate levels as 
low as those seen in 1000 m and 2000 m intervals.
Coach 8: To develop capacity in triathlon, we 
conduct BRICK sessions around the anaerobic 
threshold. These are sessions where we combine 
either swimming and cycling or cycling and running 
around the anaerobic threshold. During these 
sessions, the pace is not consistent throughout, as 
the demands of Olympic distance racing require this 
approach. This means that the swim portion starts 
at race pace for the first minute before reducing the 
intensity to around the anaerobic threshold. For 
the cycling intervals, we regularly incorporate short 
sprints of 5-8 seconds to simulate the accelerations 
required after sharp turns on the racecourse.
“Anaerobic” endurance training (i.e., training above 
the lowest power or pace eliciting ­VO2max, in this study 
categorized as zone-6 training) is generally given limited 
emphasis in daily training and is often performed in 
combination with or at the end of zone-5 sessions (see 
examples of quotes in Table  1). However, interview 
data and training plans showed that some specific 
anaerobic sessions, highly sport-specific and carefully 
designed based on the demands of the competition 
event, are performed in the last weeks before important 
competitions.
Strength, speed, and technique drills are the most 
variably prescribed training components across the 
analyzed sports (Fig.  2 and Table  4). Coaches in most 
sports highlighted that emphasis is placed on exercises 
connected to sport-specific demands, with substantial 
differences in the amount of strength and speed training 
prescribed. Sport-specific features are detailed in Table 3; 
however, the coaches also highlight individual differences 
in the amount of strength and speed training. Three 
quotes from coaches exemplify this:
Coach 4: Strength training is split in two; heavy 
strength training is done in specific exercises to 
mimic the movement of our sport, while core and 
stability training is more general although they 
should lead to better ability to execute the specific 
movement.
Coach 3: My impression is that larger and more 
powerful athletes should perform less strength 
training than weaker athletes.
Coach 7: I normally recommend women to start 
earlier and conduct slightly more strength training 
than men, especially in our sport where upper body 
power is a performance-determining factor.
Training Quality
Coaches across all sports considered the achievement of 
high training quality as an important and continuously 
evolving process to obtain success in their sport. The 
primary quality defining aspects highlighted are related 
to three main areas: (1) optimizing the prescription and 
execution of key training sessions (especially those in 
zone 3–5), (2) assuring that training load and recovery are 
balanced and provide optimal conditions for adaptations 
to accumulate over time, and (3) ensuring that athletes 
are in their best condition for peak performance during 
the most important competitions (see representative 
quotes for all three areas in Table 1).
In this context, coaches across all sports emphasize 
a close dialogue with athletes and the application of 
decision-support tools to enhance the accuracy of 
training sessions and to treat these sessions as invaluable 
learning opportunities. Here, the use of global navigation 
satellite systems (GNSS), in addition to heart rate and 
blood lactate measurements in daily training were used 
in many sports. Additionally, thorough documentation of 
training routines and regular testing of the main factors 
determining performance is used regularly with a sport-
specific approach. This is exemplified by the following 
statements:
Coach 4: We obtain information to take good 
decisions by combining subjective observations, 
which means that I have regular dialogues with 
athletes and am present at sessions, with objective 
measurements through the use of training diaries, 
standardized training sessions, as well as integrating 
technology to fine-tune training strategies and 
adaptive responses.

Discussion
In this analysis of best-practice training characteristics 
within Olympic endurance sports as described by 
Norwegian 
world-class 
endurance 
coaches, 
we 
uncovered profound insights into the commonalities and 
sport-specific variations in training characteristics. Our 
key findings were as following: (1) Coaches within all 
sports reported to adhere to a traditional periodization 
model, with a gradual shift towards higher proportion 
of intensive training with reduced volume as the 
competition period approaches. Within this model, 
coaches pragmatically align training organization with 
the various constraints faced in the training process; (2) 
In all endurance sports, a high sport-specific training 
volume was emphasized, with the majority performed in 
zone 1, interspersed with 2–3 weekly key days consisting 
of 3–5 intensive sessions, although these are seldom 
performed to exhaustion; (3) Substantial sport-specific 
differences in training characteristics were evident in 
terms of volume, intensity distribution across zones 3, 4, 
and 5, and application of cross training and periodization, 
mainly due to variations in competition distance, exercise 
mode constraints (i.e., mechanical, and muscular loading) 
and organizational aspects (competition schedule, access 
to snow/ice/water, etc.); (4) Particular focus was paid on 
achieving high training quality, which the coaches define 
in terms of optimal execution of training sessions, good 
load-recovery balance and long-term preparations for 
major competitions.
Training Organization and Periodization
Coaches in all analyzed sports reported that they use 
a traditional periodization model. This concept was 
originally developed by Matveyev in the 1950s and 
characterized by four key features: (1) division of 
the training year into distinct, ordered phases with 
the explicit aim of peaking for the most important 
competitions, (2) a gradual transition from high-
volume and low-intensity training towards higher 
training intensity and reduced volume as the major 
competitions approach, (3) a rhythmicity where hard 
training periods should be accompanied by easy 
training periods, and (4) reduced training variation 
and increased specificity throughout the macro-cycle 
[38]. Although the sports analyzed in this study follow 
a more dynamic and less “schematic” approach than 
Matveyev, they generally adhere to the traditional 
periodization model. These findings are in line with 
previous reports on elite biathletes and cross-country 
skiers, where the authors concluded that modified 
versions of the traditional model were applied [20, 37].
Despite its popularity, the traditional periodization 
model has been associated with several limitations. 
This includes a focus on simultaneous development 
of underlying performance components. It has been 
argued that high volumes of concurrently targeted 
abilities in complex sports may hamper further 
progression because incompatible workloads can cause 
conflicting adaptive signaling [41]. However, most 
aerobic endurance sports can be considered relatively 
“simple”, as performance is mainly determined by 
compatible variables such as maximum oxygen 
uptake, its fractional utilization and work economy/
efficiency [53], possibly explaining the widespread 
use of traditional periodization among the present 
coaches. A more serious limitation associated with 
traditional periodization might be related to athletes’ 
ability to maintain peak performance over time, as it 
is challenging to perform on a high level over several 
months without retraining [54]. This is likely the reason 
why some of the analyzed endurance sports with 
extended seasons (e.g., road cycling, cross-country 
skiing and biathlon) implement blocks of higher 
volume preparation training between competitions, in 
addition to specific exercise mode-focused blocks (e.g., 
winter sports seeking snow/ice during summer season), 
or during low-intensive and high-volume preparation 
periods in form of altitude training camps. Previous 
studies have also shown that blocks of altitude training 
are common practice among endurance communities 
[55–58]. However, the present data indicate that 
such blocks were used much more dynamically than 
prescribed in most theoretical block periodization 
models [40].
While block and traditional periodization tend to be 
described as competitive and contradicting models in 
scientific literature [59–63], the descriptions provided 
by this group of coaches suggest that these periodization 
models can be complementary and combined in a 
hybrid approach that is more flexible. Although the 
underlying 
mechanisms 
explaining 
superiority 
of 
specific periodization models in endurance sports 
remain unclear, several studies have concluded that 
periodized training across the annual cycle leads to 
enhanced performance improvements compared to non-
periodized and constant-repetition programs [64–66]. A 
key message from this study is that world-class coaches 
within most Olympic endurance sports use different 
periodization models pragmatically to create the best 
possible performance development given the various 
constraints influencing the training and competition 
process in their sport. However, it should be noted 

Page 16 of 23
Sandbakk et al. Sports Medicine - Open           (2025) 11:45 
that neither of these periodization models have been 
scientifically verified [60, 61, 67].
Relatively large differences in micro-periodization were 
observed across sports. In biathlon, cross-country skiing, 
rowing, and speed skating, a regular incorporation of an 
easy training load week was applied every 3–4 weeks, in 
line with traditional periodization thinking [68]. These 
easy weeks involve a reduction in training volume by 
25–35%, typically achieved by performing 1–2 fewer 
training sessions and reducing LIT session duration. 
In this way, the coaches argue that athletes recover 
more completely and can handle harder training in 
the subsequent weeks. Rhythmicity into hard and easy 
weeks is not applied during the competition period, as 
the training load is tailored to the competition schedule. 
In long-distance running and triathlon, however, the 
rhythmicity of training weeks is less pronounced, 
although consistent training routines are occasionally 
interrupted by travel, altitude camps, or competitions, 
creating periodic variations in the athletes’ training 
schedules. In cycling, the competition schedule spans 
approximately eight months, significantly dictating 
the periodization of training. Overall, the concept of 
micro-periodization has gained limited attention in 
sport science literature. However, descriptive training 
studies [4, 20, 22, 63] indicate that “planned rhythmicity” 
of preparation weeks is widespread in practical elite 
endurance training communities.
In connection with tapering, coaches across all sports 
highlight that training frequency is maintained while 
shorter sessions are performed at all intensities. The 
purpose of these unloading periods was to maintain 
capacity and, at the same time, create a surplus of mental 
and physical energy. Although the present sample of 
highly successful coaches propose smaller volume 
reductions compared to general recommendations in 
research literature [69, 70], this strategy aligns with those 
applied by elite endurance athletes in previous studies 
[20, 71]. Altogether, the current study shows novel data 
on how world-class coaches across Olympic endurance 
sports micro-periodize training according to the 
uniqueness of each sport, providing a point-of-departure 
for generating new hypothesis in this area.
The organization of day-to-day training loads is an 
almost unexplored area of research, in which most 
of the present coaches recommend two to three hard 
days spread out over the week. Their weekly training 
is centered around key workouts, typically including 
interval sessions, competitions, and progressive long-
distance sessions. That is, these key sessions are “hard” 
by virtue of an integrated intensity and duration 
approach, not intensity alone. This “hard-easy” concept 
was popularized by the legendary track & field coach 
Bill Bowerman already in the 1960s [4] and was also an 
essential feature in Matveyev’s traditional periodization 
model originated at the same time [68]. About half of the 
present coaches (long-distance running, speed skating, 
swimming, triathlon, and rowing) apply so called “double 
threshold sessions”, where two sessions (i.e., morning 
and afternoon) at moderately high intensity (zone 3) 
are performed in some of the heavy training days to 
increase the overall volume of intensive training at a 
manageable “cost” in terms of recovery time. LIT training 
is prioritized in the training days between, and although 
the volume here is relatively high, the perceived and 
experienced training load is low. Importantly, there are 
large differences across sports and between individuals 
regarding the micro-management of the training puzzle. 
Indeed, our findings show that day-to-day organization 
of training is an important area for coaches that requires 
more attention in future research.
Training Content
Our extensive analysis of training content across 
endurance sports and season time provides a nuanced 
insight into the approaches adopted by elite endurance 
coaches. The accumulation of high training volumes 
constitutes the main and most consistent component of 
their training philosophy. The overall training volume 
is highest in triathlon, followed by swimming and road 
cycling, while long distance running is the sport with 
lowest annual training volume. The numbers presented 
here are similar or slightly higher than previously 
published for world-class athletes in long-distance 
running [4–11], road cycling [12–18] and cross-country 
skiing [20–26]. In addition, we provide novel data 
supplementing previous research in swimming, biathlon, 
speed skating, rowing, and triathlon, where few previous 
studies have described the training of successful athletes 
[27–37].
Although there are differences in competition duration, 
technical complexity and traditions across sports, the 
main differences in training volume across sports are 
explained by variances in mechanical and muscular 
loading across the specific exercise modes employed 
during training, in line with recently established theories 
[43]. For example, the combination of weight-bearing 
exercise and lower-limb plyometric actions in long-
distance running results in high impact forces, leading 
to lower training volumes compared to other sports. In 
speed skating, the combination of small hip and knee 
angles, the static upper body position, and the relatively 
long muscle contraction duration leads to intermittent 
blood-flow restrictions in the working muscles. These 
constraints, combined with ice-time limitations in 
some parts of the year, explain why speed skating 

Page 17 of 23
Sandbakk et al. Sports Medicine - Open           (2025) 11:45 
	
involves “only” 150–200  h of specific, on-ice training 
per year. In contrast, concentric-only and non-weight-
bearing exercises like road cycling and swimming (and 
triathlon) are less demanding on muscle and tendon 
tissue, resulting in considerably higher tolerable volumes 
of sport-specific training. Cyclists also draft behind 
their teammates and competitors during training and 
competitions, and have significant periods of zero power 
coasting, thereby reducing average power output and 
energy expenditure, and allowing more hours of cycling. 
For more detailed information related to mechanical 
and muscular movement constraints, we refer to our 
previously published commentary about training load 
management and exercise modality [43].
Most sports analyzed in this study apply a twice-per-
day training rhythm, and the variations in the number 
of training sessions are generally less pronounced than 
differences in training hours across sports. Sport-specific 
differences in overall training volume are highly related 
to the duration of LIT-sessions, in line with previous 
observations [43]. These differences diminish with 
increasing training intensity. Interestingly, although 
the overall training volume is high, considerably fewer 
sessions are performed in road cycling, as cyclists 
typically perform one long daily session lasting 3–6  h. 
This aligns with the sport-specific demands in cycling 
[72], while the physiological effects of one long versus 
two “short” training sessions per day remains to be 
examined.
The large focus on LIT among world-class endurance 
athletes is consistent with previous research across 
endurance sports [4–18, 20–35], and the examined 
coaches argue that this allows athletes to build what many 
of them called a robust “aerobic base”. The physiological 
foundation for this “aerobic base” remains a discussed 
topic both in practice and research, and the underlying 
mechanisms are not clear [73]. Likely, these include a 
combination of cardiovascular and muscular adaptations. 
Although it has been observed that also maximal oxygen 
uptake increases from junior to age of peak performance 
among medal-winning endurance athletes [26], fractional 
utilization of maximal oxygen uptake, efficiency and 
durability likely develop more in parallel with increased 
LIT towards peak performance [74].
Interestingly, the majority of LIT is performed in zone 1, 
while the incorporation of zone 2 training highlights the 
subtle, yet essential adjustments made to optimize sport-
specific technical and tactical elements. We can only 
speculate if the negative consequences of too much time 
in zone 2 overshadow the corresponding positive effects 
for elite athletes in most endurance sports, and that zone 
1 allows adequate stimulus if the duration is sufficient. 
The cautious and conscious use of zone 2, as exemplified 
in the result section, provides a nuanced view on how 
acknowledged endurance practitioners balance the cost–
benefit of LIT. This novel and imperative feature would 
not have been discovered by a commonly used 3-zone 
scale (LIT, MIT and HIT), highlighting the potential 
advantages of a more fine-tuned intensity scale. It should 
be noted that the demarcation of zone 1 and zone 2 in 
the Norwegian intensity zone model (see methods) 
is practical and arbitrary, not based on a specifically 
identified physiological marker, such as fat max intensity, 
or a specific respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Although 
we have described typical session models for zone 1 and 
2 used by these coaches in a connected study [48], more 
research is needed to improve our understanding on how 
intensity and duration interact in this relatively broad 
“low intensity range”, given how many training hours are 
performed there by the best endurance athletes.
The current data demonstrate that the amount of 
non-specific 
or 
cross-training 
varies 
considerably 
among the analyzed sports. The coaches indicate that 
these differences are mainly explained by seasonal 
considerations, movement constraints and muscular 
load management. In biathlon and cross-country skiing, 
endurance training on skis or roller skis are mainly 
supplemented by running with and without poles during 
the summer, supporting observations from previous 
studies [20–22]. Similarly for rowing, substantial 
amounts of land-based activities such as running, 
cycling or cross-country skiing (possibly unique to 
Norwegian rowers) are implemented during the winter 
when access to water is limited. In speed skating, most 
training is performed in form of cycling since specific 
on-ice, deep aero position training is associated with 
high muscular load/strain and thereby challenging to 
perform as LIT. Supporting scientific arguments for the 
implementation of cross-training include prevention of 
training monotony, injury prevention, and general central 
capacity effects [75]. However, in swimming, road cycling 
and triathlon, the implementation of cross-training is 
limited or non-existent, possibly because all or most of 
the training in these sports is non-weight-bearing (i.e., 
cycling and swimming), making it less challenging to 
perform high specific training-volumes in these sports. 
We can only speculate why cross-training is sparsely used 
in long-distance running, but alternative locomotion 
modalities may be too far away from the sport-specific 
mechanical and neuromuscular demands, enhancing 
the likelihood for mal-adaptations. Instead, world-class 
long-distance practitioners perform substantial parts 
of their running training on gravel roads and treadmills 
to reduce ballistic loading and prevent injuries, in line 
with previous reports [4, 11]. For the same reasons, the 
amount of track training is limited during the preparation 

Page 18 of 23
Sandbakk et al. Sports Medicine - Open           (2025) 11:45 
phase, increasing gradually when the competition period 
approaches.
Triathlon combines swimming, cycling, and running, 
which are trained both separately and in combination, 
and the transitions between the modalities represent a 
crucial feature in the training of triathletes (referred to 
as BRICK sessions for reasons that remain disputed). The 
reported training volume in training hours for triathlon 
in this study exceeds previous reports of corresponding 
elite athletes by large margins [34–36] and is, in fact, the 
highest training volume ever reported. Although many of 
the training principles mentioned for swimming, cycling, 
and running also apply to triathlon, triathletes train less 
in each of these disciplines compared to “pure” specialists 
and prioritize training according to the sub-disciplines’ 
specific role in competitions. Regarding triathlon swim 
training, the importance of a fast start to avoid “traffic”, as 
well as the technical limitations of triathletes compared 
to swimmers, are presented as arguments for why a 
considerably lower proportion of the swimming training 
is performed as LIT. In cycling and running, however, 
the training patterns of triathletes are relatively similar 
to specially trained athletes in these disciplines, although 
training duration within each sub-discipline is lower for 
triathletes. Indeed, the training of triathletes warrants 
more attention in research literature, and the present 
findings may catalyze future studies.
Although intensive training in the form of zones 3–5 
only accounts for 10–15% of the total training time, the 
absolute time at these intensities can add up to 2–3  h 
per week. Interestingly, coaches across all examined 
sports consider such training fundamental for endurance 
performance progression. However, there are significant 
sport-specific 
differences 
regarding 
how 
intensive 
training is implemented (see Table 3 and the connected 
study published previously [48]). In all sports, most of 
the intensive training time is performed in zone 3 while 
a smaller proportion is in zone 4–5. The latter is mainly 
explained by longer work duration for zone 3 sessions, 
and/or the use of two zone 3 sessions on intensive days 
in some sports during the preparation phase. In addition, 
during higher intensity (zone 4 and 5), time within zone 
3 will accumulate during transitions. In general, the 
amount of zone 3 follows the total training volume across 
sports, except for long-distance running where zone 3 is 
used extensively and constitutes a larger proportion of 
training than for other sports. The effects of zone 3 are 
sparsely described in scientific literature. Importantly, 
elite endurance athletes demonstrate “intensity scale 
compression”, with widening of their zone 1 and 2 range, 
and relative compression of zones 3, 4, and 5. Taking the 
present findings together with previous observations 
[4, 11], it is reasonable to assume that elite endurance 
athletes combine high maximal oxygen uptake with high 
fractional utilization of their maximal aerobic capacity, 
enabling them to work with high external power over 
long periods, thereby developing both aerobic power 
and technical skills effectively during zone 3-sessions. In 
addition, it is important to be aware that in some of the 
examined sports, especially long distance running and 
swimming, some of the zone 3 sessions are designed in a 
way that makes metabolic markers stay within the zone, 
while speed or power is markedly higher, approaching 
zones 4–5 [48]. For example, long distance runners can 
perform short intervals (20–25 × 400 m repeats with 30 s 
recoveries, for example) at speeds that would correspond 
to zone 4–5 if the intervals were longer. However, the 
short breaks allow heart rate and lactate to stay within 
the ranges of zone 3. Still, the underlying physiological 
mechanisms for the effects of MIT on endurance 
performance require further elucidation.
Most HIT training is performed in zone 4, especially 
during the preparation phase, and mainly as interval 
training. Most zone-5 training was either achieved 
during competitions or as specific interval sessions 
designed to reproduce important power/pace demands 
in key events and mainly used when tapering for 
competitions. The slightly lower intensity in zone 4 
allows for disproportionately greater accumulated work 
duration as described previously [48] and, according to 
the coaches here, faster recovery from day to day. The 
net effect of this is that athletes accumulate more time 
at high intensity and achieve a greater peaking effect 
when zone-5 training becomes more pronounced as 
the competition season approaches. This assumption is 
also supported by previous research [76–78]. Similarly, 
the possibility to accumulate more work at high, 
competition-like intensities supports the application of 
intervals ahead of continuous intensive sessions [79–82]. 
However, in triathlon and speed skating, zone-5 training 
is used more extensively. In triathlon, the necessity of 
a fast start in the swimming part combined with less 
developed technique leads to a larger proportion of 
zone-5 training compared to specialized swimmers. The 
same applies to speed skating where the low amount 
of ice training and the muscularly demanding skating 
position limit specific training mainly to HIT, involving 
relatively large proportions of zone 5 at the expense of 
zone 3–4 compared to most other endurance sports 
[83]. Overall, these examples, in combination with 
descriptions of typical session designs by Tønnessen 
et al. [48], demonstrate how HIT is tailored to the sport-
specific demands.
Most endurance sports include a few thoughtfully 
integrated “anaerobic capacity” workouts, particularly 
when approaching key competitions. Such zone-6 

Page 19 of 23
Sandbakk et al. Sports Medicine - Open           (2025) 11:45 
	
training is tailored specifically to each sport’s demands 
and individual capacities, not only to improve the 
athletes’ physical capabilities, but also to enhance mental 
resilience and prepare them for the stochastic pacing 
challenges likely to be encountered in competition [48]. 
In addition to aerobic and anaerobic endurance training, 
the coaches employ diverse training forms across sports. 
Strength and speed training account for a relatively 
small portion of the overall training in all examined 
sports, tailored to individual needs and emphasizing a 
sport-specific approach. This is supported by scientific 
literature, where small doses of strength and power 
training have shown positive effects on endurance 
performance [84–89]. However, there seem to be large 
differences among the analyzed sports in this study, 
highlighting a need for follow-up studies examining the 
nuanced implementation of strength and speed training 
in different endurance sports. The same applies for speed 
training and sport-specific drills, which are systematically 
implemented in some of the sports, although the 
scientific support for such methods are limited or 
non-existent.
Training Quality
Complementary to objective training periodization and 
loading characteristics, the interview data underscores 
the multifaceted approach adopted to ensure high 
training quality. More specifically, the coaches in all 
examined sports emphasize three pivotal aspects: 
optimizing key training sessions, optimizing the balance 
between training load and recovery and preparing 
athletes for peak performance in major competitions. 
This aligns with recent theories on training quality 
outlined previously [45, 46]. Here, training quality is 
related to two interconnected dimensions: quality of 
prescription and execution of specific training sessions 
aiming to optimize the training stimulus, and quality 
of the holistic training process aiming to optimize the 
adaptive responses and performance over time. The 
first component of training quality is related to assuring 
quality of individual training sessions, as described in 
Tønnessen et  al. [48], while the two latter are related 
to managing and optimizing the longitudinal training 
process to reach peak performance.
The aim of optimizing the training outcome is evident 
from the interview data, where meticulous planning, 
precise execution, and continuous reflective analysis 
are regarded as key factors. However, this process also 
highlights the integration of the two dimensions of 
training quality, since it involves multiple and entangled 
factors such as goal setting, analyzing sport-specific 
requirements, monitoring and determining athlete 
capacity, conducting gap analyses, and continuous 
planning, execution and evaluation of training [45]. 
Indeed, the present coaches are highly involved in all 
these processes. In particular, the coaches highlight that 
they invest substantial time in planning, often involving 
athletes in the process. The coach-athlete communication 
is especially detailed in conjunction with key sessions, 
with coaches in some of the sports presenting the session 
plan well in advance, while others allow athletes to plan 
and present session suggestions to them. This is very 
likely a smart approach, as successful athletes possess 
high levels of dedication and a strong sense of ownership 
of their training process, clearly contributing to the 
development of expertise [90, 91].
One important aspect highlighted is the synergy 
achieved by integrating subjective observations and 
objective measurements as part of effective coaching. 
Our interpretation is that all the coaches aim to create 
a good learning environment and autonomy-support 
in the decision making. This is particularly apparent 
during interval sessions, with utilization of timing, 
heart rate, lactate measurements and close dialogs 
with athletes for intensity control purposes. While 
objective and quantitative training load monitoring 
tools and procedures are extensively described in 
research literature [92, 93], subjective and qualitative 
observations and athlete feedback has so far received 
considerably less attention. The continuous dialogues 
with athletes, careful documentation of training routines, 
and systematic testing of underlying performance factors 
provide coaches informed insights and form their basis 
for decision-making [45]. This approach also facilitates 
meaningful discussions and enriches the learning 
experience for both athletes and coaches. By aligning 
coaches’ observations and athletes’ perceptions with 
relevant objective data, this approach empowers coaches 
with a deep and individually optimized understanding 
of the training process. For example, post-training 
reflections and evaluations undertaken by the coach 
and athlete(s) serve as invaluable learning opportunities 
[45]. By identifying successful strategies and areas for 
improvement, such reflections refine future sessions, 
enhancing overall training quality and foster a continuous 
cycle of improvement and athlete development. Indeed, 
such a coaching strategy depends on a perfect match 
in characteristics and personalities between coach and 
athlete [91], and the present coaches have undoubtedly 
established a culture of continuous learning and 
development through constructive interactions with the 
athletes. In addition, the coaches must critically consider 
what information they use in the decision-making 
process, both to assure valid and reliable data and to 
avoid data-overload [94]. Overall, this study extends this 
area of research by providing specific insights into the 

Page 20 of 23
Sandbakk et al. Sports Medicine - Open           (2025) 11:45 
integration of subjective observations and objective data, 
highlighting the holistic approach adopted by coaches in 
enhancing training quality.
Methodological Rigor and Limitations
For the qualitative data, we considered eight key markers 
of quality as proposed by Tracy [95]: (a) worthy topic, (b) 
rich rigor, (c) sincerity, (d) credibility, (e) resonance, (f) 
significant contribution, (g) ethics, and (h) meaningful 
coherence. As stated in the introduction, we regard this 
as a worthy topic because it addresses critical questions 
on achieving a world-class level in Olympic endurance 
sports. We aimed at rich rigor, sincerity and credibility 
by the use of established data collection methods that 
yielded complex qualitative and quantitative data 
from diverse perspectives, a comprehensive review 
and negotiation process to clarify and ensure that the 
findings accurately reflected the coaches’ perspectives, 
as well as transparency in reporting of methods and 
limitations. We believe this research makes a significant 
contribution to the scientific field and practice. Ethical 
processes included obtaining the necessary approvals 
for conducting the study, along with respectful methods 
to ensure interdependence between researcher and 
participants. Finally, meaningful coherence was achieved 
by adhering to the intended project design, with 
alignment of study objectives, epistemology, conceptual 
frameworks, methodology and presentation of study 
findings.
To reduce the likelihood of bias and misinterpretations, 
triangulation of multiple methods, data sources and 
investigators was used. However, our design also presents 
several limitations. While this study design allowed 
for a comprehensive overview, it is acknowledged that 
similar training strategies might have been unsuccessfully 
pursued by other athletes, indicating a need for nuanced 
interpretation. It is also worth mentioning that we have 
not taken individual approaches into account in this 
study but presented more general views on the training 
needed to reach world-class levels in the examined 
sports. It is also worth mentioning that this study only 
captures a snapshot of coaches’ perspectives and future 
research could benefit from adopting a longitudinal 
approach to track these perspectives on training 
characteristics over an entire season. Furthermore, the 
study exclusively focused on male Norwegian coaches, 
providing rich insights into a specific cultural context but 
limiting generalizability. While we recognize that wider 
socio-cultural factors may be implicated in the success of 
athletes, this was outside the scope of the current paper.
The authors’ background in the Norwegian Olympic 
system, although valuable, also introduces potential 
biases. Specifically, our experience spans over 30  years, 
during which we have closely collaborated with world-
class endurance coaches and athletes, both within the 
Norwegian Olympic Sports Center (Olympiatoppen) and 
various national sport federations. We contend that this 
wealth of experience uniquely qualifies us to collect and 
interpret the data for this study. However, we are aware 
that our background introduces potential biases.
Finally, this study did not focus on possible sex 
differences in training characteristics. However, based 
on data collected for the same overall project [96], we 
previously examined how successful coaches perceived 
sex/gender differences in training characteristics and 
coaching practices among medal-winning endurance 
athletes. They all tailored training content and coaching 
practices to the individual athlete rather than focusing 
on 
gender. 
A 
coach-driven 
and 
athlete-centered 
individualization process appeared essential to create 
trust, mutual understanding, and to craft optimal 
training content. In this process, potential gender/sex-
specific differences in competition demands, physiology, 
and psychology, as well as interpersonal factors such as 
the gender of the coach, were considered.
With these limitations in mind, transparent reporting 
and 
acknowledgment 
of 
these 
methodological 
considerations are essential for a comprehensive and 
critical evaluation of the study’s findings.
Conclusions
This study describes best-practice training characteristics 
within Olympic endurance sports as described by 
Norwegian world-class endurance coaches, shedding light 
on both commonalities and sport-specific variations in 
training organization and characteristics. The key findings 
reveal that periodization strategies are generally consistent 
across sports, with general adherence to a traditional 
periodization model, including a gradual shift towards 
lower overall training volume and more competition-
specific training as the competitive period approaches. 
However, within this model, a pragmatic approach to align 
training organization with the various constraints faced 
in the training process is used in all sports. Furthermore, 
coaches across all sports consistently emphasize a high 
training volume of zone 1 training supplemented by 3–5 
strategically placed intensive training sessions across 
2–3  days each week. The application of fundamental 
training principles leads to significant sport-specific 
differences in training characteristics in terms of volume, 
intensity distribution, and application of cross training 
and periodization, mainly due to variations in competition 
duration, exercise mode constraints (i.e., mechanical, and 
muscular loading) and organizational aspects. Finally, 
achievement of high training quality represents a particular 
concern among coaches in all examined sports, mainly in

form of training session optimization, careful management 
of the load-recovery balance, and ensuring optimal 
preparation for major competitions. Overall, these features 
contribute to a deeper understanding of the training 
characteristics employed in Olympic endurance sports, 
facilitating the development of evidence-based training 
practices aimed at enhancing athlete performance.
