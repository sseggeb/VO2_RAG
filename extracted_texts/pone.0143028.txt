Abstract
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of moderate-high altitude on power out-
put, cadence, speed and heart rate during a multi-day cycling tour.
Methods
Power output, heart rate, speed and cadence were collected from elite male road cyclists
during maximal efforts of 5, 15, 30, 60, 240 and 600 s. The efforts were completed in a labo-
ratory power-profile assessment, and spontaneously during a cycling race simulation near
sea-level and an international cycling race at moderate-high altitude. Matched data from the
laboratory power-profile and the highest maximal mean power output (MMP) and corre-
sponding speed and heart rate recorded during the cycling race simulation and cycling race
at moderate-high altitude were compared using paired t-tests. Additionally, all MMP and
corresponding speeds and heart rates were binned per 1000m (<1000m, 1000–2000,
2000–3000 and >3000m) according to the average altitude of each ride. Mixed linear
modelling was used to compare cycling performance data from each altitude bin.
Results
Power output was similar between the laboratory power-profile and the race simulation,
however MMPs for 5–600 s and 15, 60, 240 and 600 s were lower (p  0.005) during the
race at altitude compared with the laboratory power-profile and race simulation, respec-
tively. Furthermore, peak power output and all MMPs were lower ( 11.7%, p  0.001)
while racing >3000 m compared with rides completed near sea-level. However, speed asso-
ciated with MMP 60 and 240 s was greater (p < 0.001) during racing at moderate-high alti-
tude compared with the race simulation near sea-level.

Conclusion
A reduction in oxygen availability as altitude increases leads to attenuation of cycling power
output during competition. Decrement in cycling power output at altitude does not seem to
affect speed which tended to be greater at higher altitudes.
Introduction
Early research has described the performance characteristics of historic competitive cycling
events that predominantly take place at low altitudes (< 1000 m). Ebert, et al. [1] determined
that cyclists spend most time (~80%) at low to moderate power outputs (2–4.9 W.kg-1) and
least time at highest power outputs (>8 W.kg-1) during flat, hilly and criterium races. Further-
more, Ebert, et al. [1] reported that for all race types, there are numerous (20–70), short dura-
tion bursts (3–30 s) at power greater than the power output associated with maximal oxygen
uptake. Others have described cycling events by reporting the typical heart rate response to
cycling competition. Although the heart rate response may vary depending on the type and ter-
rain of an event, mean heart rates for competitive road cycling races are ~135 beats per minute
(bpm), with higher values (>140 bpm) for time trials or hilly events [2–5]. Cycling cadence
and speed, like heart rate, are largely affected by the type and terrain of a race. Generally slow-
est speeds and cadences are reported during hilly events while fastest speeds and cadences are
reported during flat races and time trials [1–3].
In recent years, road cycling events sanctioned by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI),
have spread globally and are more frequently occurring, either partly or entirely, in moderate-
high altitude (2000–5000 m) environments (e.g. Tour of Qinghai Lake, Tour of Utah, stages of
Grand Tours). As most famously observed at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City, compe-
tition at altitude has consequences for both speed and endurance, with lower air density having
a positive impact on speed over short distances, whilst endurance performance is impaired [6].
The change to inspired partial pressure of oxygen at higher altitudes presents a number of chal-
lenges to underlying physiological processes that determine or regulate cycling performance.
Laboratory based investigations have reported that cycling power output for short to long
intervals is attenuated during acute exposure to normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions
[7–9]. Reductions in power output during laboratory cycling are likely the result of a decrease
in the oxygenation of muscular and cerebral tissue leading to perturbations to working muscle
metabolism, central neural drive and pacing regulation [7–10]. Such changes are likely to be
reflected by changes in the performance characteristics of real world cycling competitions
occurring in similar conditions. Others have reported changes in activity distribution and per-
formance indices during team sports at moderate-high altitude [11–13]. Alternatively, it is pos-
sible the reduced air density at altitude results in faster cycling speeds for the same power
output, resulting in faster cycling races than at sea level [14–16]. However, to our knowledge
no articles exist describing the effects of moderate-high altitude on the performance of cyclists
during competitive road events.
Therefore, while the performance characteristics of cycling competitions that take place at
relatively low altitudes (<1000 m) have been well described, the effects of moderate-high alti-
tude on competitive cycling performance remain largely unknown. Consequently, the purpose
of this study was to quantify the acute effects of racing at moderate-high altitude on power out-
put, speed and heart rate compared with sea level efforts in a group of non-acclimatized, low
altitude natives. We hypothesized that cycle racing at moderate-high altitude would result in a

decrement in mean maximal power (MMP) output, particularly for time durations greater
than one minute. Secondly, we hypothesized that cycling speed would be maintained at high
altitude due to the reduction in air density.
Methods
Study Design
Ride data of elite male cyclists (Table 1) were collected during a seven-day cycling race simulation
near sea level (n = 12) and during a 14-day cycling stage race at moderate to high altitude
(n = 14) [17]. Cyclists who completed the seven-day race simulation also completed a power-pro-
file test in controlled laboratory conditions, near sea level (n = 12). The study was approved by
the Australian Institute of Sport Human Ethics Committee and the Qinghai Institute of Sport
Science Ethics Committee. All cyclists provided written informed consent before participating.
Power-Profile Test
The power-profile test [18] was completed by all cyclists involved in the simulated tour
(n = 12). The test was conducted at ~600m altitude in controlled laboratory conditions at the
Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra using a custom built wind-braked ergometer fitted with
a dynamically calibrated scientific eight strain gauge SRM power meter (SRM Training System,
Schoberer Rad Messtecknick, Germany), with power sampled at 5 Hz. The individual bicycle
riding position of each rider was replicated on the ergometer along with their respective pedal
system and crank length. Following a self-selected warm up (~15min at 100–200W including
2–3 rolling sprints), the cyclists were asked to produce sequentially, six maximal self-paced
efforts (2 x 5, 15, 30, 60, 240 s) from a rolling start with active recovery periods of 55, 175, 225,
330, and 480 s, respectively. Power data were analysed using commercially available software
(SRM, Version 6.42.18) after each test. Specifically, peak power (1 s peak), and the maximum
mean power (MMP) and heart rate (HR) for 5, 15, 30, 60, and 240 s were identified. In addi-
tion, the MMP for 600 s was predicted using the critical power feature of the publically avail-
able software (Golden Cheetah, Version 3.0.2). The power profile test has previously been
shown to predict cycling road MMP within race situations [18], and is therefore an ecologically
valid tool to assess cycling specific power producing capabilities.
Race Simulation near Sea Level
In the absence of a suitably comparable tour at sea level, twelve cyclists, from two teams, ros-
tered to compete in the 2013 edition of the Tour of Qinghai Lake completed a simulation of the

Tour, near sea level (Canberra and surrounds, Australia) one month prior to the race in China.
Due to the racing schedules of the riders, it was only possible to simulate the first seven stages
of the race (S 1–7). Each “stage” was re-created based on the course description listed on the
race organiser’s website, with the aim being to replicate the stage distance and elevation gain as
closely as possible (Table 2). The elevation gain was measured with barometric altimeters
(SRM PC7 Schoberer Rad Messtecknick, Germany; or Garmin Edge 500, Garmin, USA) which
have been previously shown to provide consistent measures of elevation gain [19]. In addition,
race scenarios and tactics, including sprint primes and breakaways were recreated with the
assistance of coaching staff in an attempt to introduce race intensity to the simulation. Due to
injuries sustained in training during the three weeks prior to the Tour of Qinghai Lake, two
cyclists were unable to travel to China and were replaced by reserves. Thus, ten cyclists com-
pleted both the simulated tour and the Tour of Qinghai Lake.
Tour of Qinghai Lake
The 2013 Tour of Qinghai Lake was a sanctioned UCI 2.HC (hors category) race and consisted
of 13 stages with one rest day after the first eight stages. The race began in Xining, in the Qing-
hai Province of China and covered 2002 km before the finish in Lanzhou. The average altitude
of the entire race was 2496 m, however the first eight stages occurred at highest altitudes
(>2000 m, Tour-H), while the remaining five stages took place at lower altitudes (<2000 m,
Tour-L). Stages were classified by race organisers as mountainous (MTN), hilly or flat accord-
ing to the elevation profile of each individual stage. Each team consisted of seven riders and
included UCI Pro Tour, Pro-Continental, Continental and National teams. Five riders from
the two teams participating in the study were withdrawn from the race to due to injury, illness
or failure to complete a stage within the allocated finishing time.

Ride data
All ride data were collected using dynamically calibrated SRM (SRM Training System, Scho-
berer Rad Messtecknick, Germany) or Quarq (Quarq Elsa, Quarq, USA) power meters and
data loggers (SRM PC7 Schoberer Rad Messtecknick, Germany or Garmin Edge 500, Garmin
USA). Each power meter was calibrated using a dynamic calibration rig as described previously
[20]. The zero offset for each power meter was configured using the “automatic” function, as
per the manufacturers’ recommendations. Power, speed, cadence, distance and heart rate were
collected at 1 Hz for the duration of each ride and logged data were downloaded onto a laptop
and analysed using publically available software (Golden Cheetah, version 3.0.2).
Data Analyses
After removing erroneous data files (n = 13) and accounting for rider withdrawal due to injury,
illness or failure to complete a stage within the allocated finishing time (n = 5), a total of 187
rides were available for analysis. The following variables were calculated for each ride 1) total
race distance (km), time (min), total elevation gain (TEG) (m) and mean altitude (m); 2) mean
power (W), speed (km.h-1), cadence (revolutions.min-1—rpm), heart rate (beats.min-1—bpm);
3) peak power and heart rate 4) MMP for 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 240 and 600 s (W); 5) mean speed
associated with MMP for 5, 15, 30, 60, 240 and 600 s; 6) mean heart rate associated with MMP
for 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 240 and 600 s; 7) percentage of total race time spent in relative power bands
of < 1.9, 2.0 to 4.9, 5.0 to 7.9 and >8.0 W.kg-1 (%) [1]; 8) percentage of total time spent in dif-
ferent cadence bands (0, 1 to 60, 61 to 80, 81 to 100, and > 100 rpm (%) [1].
Statistical Analyses
The 187 rides were initially categorised into: Race simulation 1–7 (S 1–7), race stages 1–7 (R
1–7), Tour stages 1–8 (Tour-H) and Tour stages 9–13 (Tour-L). Ten cyclists completed the lab-
oratory power-profile test, S 1–7 and R 1–7 (Table 3); thus, their matched data were compared
using paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison to determine differ-
ences in peak MMP (single highest MMP achieved by each rider during any ride within the cat-
egory) and associated heart rates and speeds (S 1–7 and R 1–7 only). The same comparisons
were made between Tour-H and Tour-L for the nine cyclists who completed the entire race.
To further quantify the effects of altitude on cycling performance, the 187 rides were
‘binned’ according to their mean altitude and linear mixed models were fitted using the “nlme”
package for the statistical program R (Version 3.1.0; R Foundation for Statistical Consulting).
Subsequently, altitude was considered a factor of four levels; near sea-level (race simulation
and the reference level for altitude), 1000–2000 m, 2000–3000 m and >3000 m. Race character-
istics (power, speed, cadence and heart rate), all MMP for 1–600 s and the proportion of race
time spent in different power output and cadence bands were fitted as response variables, with
altitude and cyclist included as the fixed and random effects respectively. To support interpre-
tation, estimates of the fixed effects, obtained from the log scale, have been converted to a per-
centage change in each respective response variable and displayed with their 95% confidence

Results
Race Characteristics
Table 4 outlines the general characteristics for rides completed during the race simulation and
during the Tour of Qinghai Lake binned according to altitude. Mean power for rides completed
during S 1–7 ranged from 186 to 213 W while mean power during R 1–7 ranged from 147 to
194 W. Mean heart rate ranged from 123 to 139 bpm during S 1–7 and was similar R 1–7
(121–142 bpm), while mean cadence ranged from 78 to 91 rpm during S 1–7, and like heart
rate, was similar during R 1–7 (80–89 rpm). Conversely, mean speed tended to be lower during
the S 1–7 (29.3–28.7 km.h-1) compared with R 1–7 (28.8–44.1 km.h-1).
Power Output
There were no significant differences between MMP measured during the laboratory power-
profile test and peak MMP measured during S 1–7 (Fig 1). However, MMP 5–600 s were signif-
icantly lower (p  0.003) during R 1–7 compared with the laboratory power-profile and MMP
15, 60, 240 and 600 s were significantly lower (p  0.004) during R 1–7 compared with the S
1–7. Generally, MMP’s were similar for Tour-H compared with Tour-L, however MMP 30 and
240 s were significantly higher during Tour-L when compared to Tour-H.
When comparing rides completed in different altitude bins, MMP for 1 and 5 s were similar
for races completed below 3000 m altitude (Fig 2). However, during rides above 3000 m, MMP
1 s and MMP 5 s were 11.7% (7.5–15.7%, p < 0.001; mean and 95% confidence interval [CI])
and 15.9% (10.7–20.8%, p < 0.001) lower, respectively, than rides completed near sea-level.
Maximal mean powers for 15, 30 and 60 s were substantially lower during rides completed at
2000–3000 m altitude compared with rides near sea-level and declined further during rides

Overall mean power was similar for all rides completed below 2000 m altitude (Table 4).
However, for rides completed at 2000–3000 m and above 3000 m, mean power was 12.4%
(8.1–16.6%, p < 0.001) and 12.3% (8.6–15.9%, p < 0.001) lower, respectively, than rides com-
pleted below near sea-level. Differences in mean power are reflected by the relative time spent
within different power bins (Fig 3) recorded for each altitude condition. Cyclists spent a greater
proportion of overall riding time below 2 W.kg-1 during rides completed at 2000–3000 m
(39.6%, 35.6–44.0%) and above 3000 m (34.4%, 31.5–37.7%) compared with rides at 1000–
2000 m (30.2%, 27.3–33.4%, p  0.01) and near sea-level (31%, 29.0–33.1%, P  0.02). Con-
versely, time spent in the 5–8 W.kg-1 power bin was higher during rides near sea-level (12.5%,

at 1000–2000 m during which cyclists spent slightly more time above 8 W.kg-1 (2.0%, 1.6–
2.6%, p < 0.001) compared with rides at other altitudes.
Heart Rate
The heart rates associated with MMP were similar between the power-profile, S 1–7 and R 1–7
with the exception of 240 s (Fig 1), which was significantly lower during S 1–7 compared with
the power-profile (p = 0.001) and Tour stages 1–7 (p = 0.002). There were no significant differ-
ences in any MMP associated heart rates between Tour-H and Tour-L (Fig 1). When compar-
ing rides within each specific altitude bin, mean heart rate was similar for rides in all altitude
conditions (Table 4). However, peak heart rate was 2.7–5.0% (p  0.02) lower during rides
completed above 3000 m compared with other altitude conditions.
Speed
Speeds associated with MMP were similar between S 1–7 and R 1–7 with the exception of
MMP 60 and 240 s which were significantly higher during R 1–7 (p = 0.003 and 0.002, respec-
tively). Conversely, speeds for all MMPs were similar between Tour-H and Tour-L. Mean
speed was substantially lower (7.3–39%, p  0.012) during rides completed below near sea-
level compared with rides in all other altitude conditions (Table 4).
Cadence
Mean cadence was similar for rides completed near sea-level and above 3000 m; however for
rides at 1000–2000 m and 2000–3000 m cadence was ~7.3% and ~4.6% (p < 0.001) higher
than rides completed at either lowest or highest altitudes (Table 4). In all altitude conditions,
cyclists spent the greatest proportion of ride time at 80–100 rpm (47.3–58.8%); however for
rides at 1000–2000 m and 2000–3000 m, cyclists spent a greater portion of ride time at
cadences above 100 rpm (Fig 3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the effects of moderate-high altitude on per-
formance during an international multi-day road cycling competition. The main finding of the
present study was a significant reduction in the maximal mean power outputs of sea-level
natives during cycling stage racing at moderate-high altitudes compared with laboratory
cycling assessment and a race simulation near sea-level. Additionally, power output, heart rate
and cadence data indicate that the simulated race situations provided a valid representation of
the cycling competition.
Validity of the race simulation
In lieu of a suitably comparable cycling event near sea level, a race simulation was used to
examine the performance of sea-level natives during low altitude cycle racing. A somewhat
crude comparison of mean power output, speed, heart rate and the relative time spent within
different power zones observed during the race simulation and reported by other investigations
of road cycling competitions [1–5] indicates that the race simulation was largely effective in
mimicking the physiological demands of real competition. However, more sophisticated evalu-
ation of MMP recorded for discrete time periods further indicates the simulation was a valid
example of sea-level racing. Specifically, there were no differences between power measured
during a laboratory power-profile test, which is highly predictive of sea-level performance
capability [18], and peak MMP’s recorded across the race simulation. Additionally, the heart

rates associated with simulation MMP and laboratory power-profile were similar, with the
exception of 240 s which was higher during the laboratory test. Therefore, given the broad sim-
ilarities between the race simulation, laboratory power-profile and race profiles from earlier
investigations, the race simulation appears to provide a valid representation of the physiologi-
cal and performance characteristics of cycling competition near sea level, and hence provides a
reference point for comparison to competition at altitude in the present study.
Effect of altitude on cycle racing power output
Exercise capacity was perturbed during moderate-high altitude cycling stage racing, manifest-
ing as a reduction in peak MMP for 5–600 s and 15, 60, 240 and 600 s when compared to labo-
ratory power-profile assessment and the race simulation near sea-level, respectively. The
reduction in longer duration MMP ( 240 s) observed in the current study is likely the result
of impairment of the aerobic energy system at higher altitudes. An increase in altitude is associ-
ated with a reduction in arterial oxygen availability and oxygen delivery during exercise [21–
23] which leads to a linear reduction in maximal oxygen uptake as altitude increases, particu-
larly in highly trained endurance athletes [21, 24, 25]. Indeed, further analysis using all MMPs
(i.e. not just the peak) recorded throughout the race simulation and Tour of Qinghai Lake
revealed a decline in MMP for 240 and 600 s of ~6% per 1000 m above sea-level, confirming
the results of earlier laboratory analyses [8, 21, 25]. However, as one of a multitude of factors
that determine performance [26], it is unlikely a decline in oxygen uptake explains all changes
observed in the present study. Alterations in the ventilatory response to exercise, including an
increase in ventilation [21] and the ventilatory equivalents for O2 and CO2 [22], have also been
reported in hypoxia. Additionally, Valli, et al. [27] suggested the hyperventilatory response to
hypoxia could create a diversion of blood flow to the inspiratory muscles. The overall sum of
the ventilatory response to hypoxia is therefore likely to increase the energy and O2 cost of
inspiration and inhibit exercise performance at high altitude.
An interesting and novel finding of the present study was a decline in short duration and
high intensity cycling (MMP 60 s) for which the contribution of oxidative energetic pathways
is low [28]. In contrast, previous investigations reported no decline in sprint cycling perfor-
mance in hypoxia when performed as an isolated 30 s effort [29] or as the first in a sequence of
10 s efforts [30]. However, the MMPs recorded in the current study did not occur in isolation
but more likely after earlier epochs of variable intensity cycling as necessitated by tactics and
the actions of other racers. In this regard, Smith and Billaut [30] indicated a greater amount
work was completed in normoxia compared with hypoxia when sprints were repeated multiple
times and therefore with an existing load from previous efforts. Interestingly, Smith and Billaut
[30] pointed to a marked increase in cerebral deoxygenation as being the predominant cause of
reduced sprint performance in hypoxia. Further, research indicates central neural drive is
inhibited during intense exercise in hypoxia as a result of cerebral deoxygenation [9, 10, 31] a
reduction in cerebral blood flow [9] and faster rates of peripheral muscle fatigue [7]. It is likely
the sprint performances of riders in the current study were limited by similar perturbations in
central neural drive, reflecting a reduction in global exercise capacity and not just exercise per-
formance that has a high aerobic energetic contribution.
Reductions in MMPs were reflected by a change in the overall activity profile of cycle racing
at higher altitudes. Like previous investigations of team sports [11, 12] we observed a decrease
in the proportion of time spent at higher exercise intensities. Additionally, there was a concom-
itant increase in the time spent at lower exercise intensities and mean power output was ~12%
lower during races completed above altitudes of 2000 m. Similar to previous investigations

with team sport athletes, the capacity for high intensity efforts was not preserved even with the
shift to lower overall exercise intensity.
Effect of altitude on heart rate, speed and cadence
Cycling at higher altitude presents an interesting paradox of increased speed despite inhibition
of underlying physiological processes and exercise capacity. Various models indicate the opti-
mal altitude for short to medium duration (5 s–1 hr) cycling performance is 2500–4000 m [6,
16, 32, 33] and as a result many cyclists select moderate-high altitude locations for world record
attempts. In the current study, although power output decreased at higher altitudes, there was
no negative effect on speed and in most instances speed was higher during the Tour of Qinghai
Lake compared with the race simulation near sea level. However, it is possible the higher speeds
recorded during racing were due to the larger size of the cycling peloton (in contrast to our
race simulation) which offers aerodynamic advantages [34] additional to reduced air density at
higher altitudes, as well as the circuit nature of some of the stages [1].
Given previous investigations have reported higher heart rates during sub-maximal exercise
in hypoxia [8, 21], it could be expected to observe higher mean heart rates during racing at
moderate-high altitude. As mean heart rate was similar between rides within each altitude bin,
it could therefore be suggested that hypoxia has little effect on heart rates during sub-maximal
exercise. However, as mean power was lower for rides completed above 2000 m, it would
appear that sub-maximal heart rate was higher in response to hypoxia during cycling racing. In
contrast, peak heart rate tended to be lower particularly during racing above 3000 m altitude.
Previous research has also reported a reduction in peak heart rate as altitude increases [23, 27]
and the difference in peak heart rate between sea-level and 3000 m of ~6 bpm supports the ear-
lier finding of Wehrlin and Hallen [21] of a decrease in peak heart rate of ~2 bpm per 1000 m.
Mean cadence tended to be lower for rides completed either near sea-level or >3000 m.
However this is more likely an artefact of the hillier nature of rides completed at these altitudes,
during which elevation gain was highest, as opposed to an effect of altitude. Similar to previous
investigations, cyclists spent the greatest proportion of all races at 80–100 rpm [1]. Therefore it
would seem that altitude in this instance has little effect on cycling cadence and cyclists likely
adjust gear ratios to match the lower power outputs.
Limitations
Given the applied nature of the research, the findings outlined above must be treated relative to
some limitations. Although careful consideration was given to the design of the race simula-
tion, it was not possible to control for all race scenarios, the size of the respective groups and
the actions of competitors during the Tour of Qinghai Lake. Furthermore, given the time
demands of participants, it was not possible to simulate all stages at sea-level prior to competi-
tion. Nevertheless, this study provides important empirical evidence of the changes in cycling
racing performance in moderate to high altitude environments.
Practical implications
The changes in MMP, mean power and the global activity profile described above indicate an
overall decline in exercise performance capacity as altitude increases. Such a decline has impor-
tant implications for athlete load management particularly given the growing trend towards
modelling the response to the training or competition stimuli. Therefore it would seem prudent
that scientists, coaches and athletes make changes to the parameters of respective models to
reflect an overall decline in performance capacity of ~6% per 1000m above sea-level. Competi-
tion organisers could also consider the decline in performance when planning events at high
Power Output during Racing at Altitude

altitudes which are likely to elevate physiological load and adversely affect the welfare of
competitors.
Conclusion
Maximal mean power outputs for 1–600 s were attenuated during cycle racing at moderate and
high altitudes compared with a laboratory power assessment and low altitude racing or race
simulation. Reductions in MMP’s are likely the result of reduced FiO2 associated with high alti-
tude environments and the subsequent decline in oxygen availability at the musculature of the
lower limb. However, it is possible short term MMP (1–30 s) is moderated by lower central
neural drive as it is unlikely limitations in oxygen availability would limit short duration power
output. Finally, with consideration for course design, specific race scenarios and sufficient
group sizes, it is possible to simulate a cycling road race with similar power output, heart rate
and cadence demands as real race events. Such simulations could serve as a valuable tool in
future investigations of performance altering interventions, or to further examine the physio-
logical response to cycling competition.
