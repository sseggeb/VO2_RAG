In short-term studies, block periodization of high-intensity training (HIT) has been shown
to be an effective strategy that enhances performance and related physiological factors.
However, long-term studies and detailed investigations of macro, meso, and micro-
periodization of HIT blocks in world-class endurance athletes are currently lacking.
In a recent study, we showed that the world’s most successful cross-country (XC)
skier used two different periodization models with success throughout her career. One
including extensive use of HIT blocks, namely BP, and one using a traditional method
namely TRAD. In this study, we compare BP with TRAD in two comparable successful
seasons and provide a detailed description of the annual use of HIT blocks in BP. The
participant is the most-decorated winter Olympian, with 8 Olympic gold medals, 18
world championship titles, and 114 world cup victories. Training data was categorized
by training form (endurance, strength, and speed), intensity [low (LIT), moderate (MIT),
and HIT], and mode (running, cycling, and skiing/roller skiing). No signiﬁcant difference
was found in the total endurance training load between BP and TRAD. However, training
volume in BP was lower compared to TRAD (15 ± 6 vs. 18 ± 7 h/wk, P = 0.001), mainly
explained by less LIT (13 ± 5 vs. 15 ± 5 h/wk, P = 0.004). Lower volume of MIT was also
performed in BP compared to TRAD (13 vs. 38 sessions/year), whereas the amount of
HIT was higher in BP (157 vs. 77 sessions/year). While BP included high amounts of HIT
already from the ﬁrst preparation period, followed by a reduction toward the competition
period, TRAD had a progressive increase in HIT toward the competition period. In BP,
the athlete performed seven HIT blocks, varying from 7 to 11 days, each including 8–13
HIT sessions. This study provides novel insights into successful utilization of two different
periodization models in the worlds best XC skier, and illustrates the macro, meso and
micro- periodization of HIT blocks to increase the overall amount of HIT.

Block vs. Traditional Periodization of HIT
INTRODUCTION
Cross-country (XC) skiing is regarded as one of the most
demanding endurance sports, with training and competition
challenging every step of the oxygen transport chain. Thus, XC
skiers’ training primarily targets the aerobic endurance capacity
and the most common training model among XC skiers includes
700–850 h of endurance training, distributed as 90% low (LIT),
4–5% as moderate (MIT), and 5–8% as high-intensity training
(HIT) (Sandbakk and Holmberg, 2017). Although HIT sessions
normally make up only one to three of the weekly training
sessions of XC skiers and many other endurance athletes, or
∼20% of the total annual number of sessions (Seiler, 2010; Stöggl
and Sperlich, 2015), they are keys in eliciting physiological and
performance gains (Laursen and Jenkins, 2002; Buchheit and
Laursen, 2013a,b). In fact, it is argued that an increased volume
and/or frequency of HIT would be beneﬁcial for the further
development of elite endurance athletes (Laursen, 2010).
Independent of the overall intensity distribution, most studies
report that the periodization of HIT vs. MIT and LIT in XC-skiing
is achieved via the traditional periodization model (Matwejew,
1975; Issurin, 2008; Tønnessen et al., 2014). Utilization of this
model is characterized by mixed focus on LIT, MIT, and HIT
in all periods, but with a gradual progression from high training
volume to higher training intensity, reduced volume, and training
that is more speciﬁc as the competition period approaches.
However, the traditional periodization model has received
criticism because of possible conﬂicting physiological adaptations
produced by the mixed training of many performance-related
factors simultaneously. As an alternative, it has been argued that a
more eﬀective way of organizing endurance training is to include
deﬁned blocks of increased focus on speciﬁc intensities (Issurin,
2008, 2010, 2016, 2018).
In this context, blocks of highly concentrated HIT stimulus
aims to induce a beneﬁcial metabolic impact and appropriate
hormonal response to optimize the subsequent adaptations
(Issurin, 2018). While positive short-term eﬀects of using HIT
blocks to augment training responses have been shown (Breil
et al., 2010; Støren et al., 2012; Wahl et al., 2013; Clark et al.,
2014; Rønnestad et al., 2017) only a small number of studies have
compared block periodization of HIT with evenly distributed
HIT-matched traditional-models. Some of these studies reported
superior improvements by using HIT blocks among national-
level cyclists and XC skiers (Rønnestad et al., 2014a,b, 2016),
whereas a recent study of junior XC skiers reported no beneﬁcial
eﬀects of blocking compared to an evenly distribution of HIT
(McGawley et al., 2017). However, these studies have compared
the diﬀerent periodization models by matching the overall
HIT stimulus, whereas the use of block periodization of HIT
in a real-life context is often related to an increase in the
overall HIT stimulus.
Although one long-term study followed a national level
male cyclist through 58 weeks of systematic blocking of LIT,
MIT, and HIT (Rønnestad and Hansen, 2018), most previous
studies on block periodization of HIT are limited by short
intervention periods (4–12 weeks), and none have examined
endurance athletes at a world-class level. Furthermore, there is
a lack of detailed investigations into macro-, meso-, and micro-
periodization utilizing HIT blocks and evidence on how this
model is distinguished from the traditional model according to
the organization of training across the annual cycle in world-class
endurance athletes.
In a recent study, we showed that the world’s most successful
XC skier used two diﬀerent periodization models with success
throughout her career (Solli et al., 2017). One including extensive
use of HIT blocks, namely BP, and a traditional method namely
TRAD. In this follow-up case study, the main aims are to compare
BP with TRAD in two comparably successful seasons in the
world’s best XC skier, and to provide a detailed description of her
annual use of HIT blocks. This will provide novel information on
the macro-, meso-, and micro-organization of LIT, MIT, and HIT,
and generate new hypotheses for follow-up studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participant
The participant is the most-decorated winter Olympian, with 8
Olympic gold medals, 18 world championship titles, and 114
world cup victories (FIS, 2018). The study was evaluated by
the regional ethics committee of mid-Norway and approved
by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD). Written
informed consent was obtained from the participant for
publication of this study, which was performed according to the
Helsinki declarations.
Overall Design
This study builds on a previous longitudinal training study
(Solli et al., 2017) identifying two training periodization models
(block and traditional periodization of HIT) in the skier’s
training patterns. Here, the detailed training content during one
representative year using block periodization of HIT (BP: 2005–
2006 season) and one representative year using the traditional
model (TRAD: 2014–2015). The years was selected based on
three criteria: (1) successful performance during the examined
year (she won world cup races in both sprint (0.8–1.3 km)
and distance (10–30 km) races in both seasons, which led to
victory in the sprint and overall world cup), (2) equal endurance
training load (ETL) based on training impulse (TRIMP), and
(3) detailed information about the design of training sessions
throughout the seasons.
Monitoring, Registration, and
Systematization of Training
The participant recorded all training data in diaries designed
by the Norwegian Ski Association and the Norwegian Olympic
Federation to provide a valid and accurate measurement of
training (Sylta et al., 2014). All training data was systematized
by phases [general preparation 1 and 2 (GP1 and GP2), speciﬁc
preparation (SP), and competition phase (CP)], training form
(endurance, strength, and speed), intensity (LIT, MIT, and
HIT), and speciﬁc (skiing/roller skiing) vs. non-speciﬁc (running
and cycling) exercise modes. Detailed information about the

Block vs. Traditional Periodization of HIT
registration and systematization of training data, division of
training phases, determination of intensity zones, categorization
of LIT, MIT, and HIT sessions as well as the content of speed
and strength sessions are previously described (Solli et al., 2017).
Illness days and periods was registered based on the participant’s
systematic reporting in the training diaries. ETL was calculated
by multiplying the accumulated duration of the intensity by a
multiplier for the particular intensity zone (e.g., 1 min at LIT,
MIT, and HIT is given a score of 1, 2, and 3 TRIMP, respectively).
Total ETL (TRIMP score) is then obtained by summating the
results (Foster et al., 2001). The performance development
throughout the season was investigated by comparing the average
rank in international competitions (world cup races and the
World/Olympic championships) in the ﬁrst (i.e., races before the
major championships) and the second phase (i.e., races from the
major championships and throughout the rest of the competitive
season). Since the average amount of MIT and HIT was 2–3
sessions per week (Solli et al., 2017), the deﬁnition of a HIT-block
was set as >4 sessions of HIT (not including competitions) over
a 7 days period.
Interviews
To gather additional information, ensure compliance with the
training diary commentaries, and verify the training intensity
of diﬀerent training sessions, both semi-structured interviews
and speciﬁc questions regarding the experience of the two
periodization models were conducted with the participant
and her coaches.
Statistical Analyses
All data from the investigated periods are presented as
mean ± standard deviation (SD). Variables with normal
distribution were analyzed by using a paired-sample t-test for
BP vs. TRAD. Otherwise, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used. All statistical tests were processed using IBM SPSS statistics
version 24 Software for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
United States) and Oﬃce Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA, United States).
RESULTS
Comparisons of Block and Traditional
Periodization of HIT
Total Training Volume and Load
No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found in the weekly ETL between
BP and TRAD (1058 ± 368 vs. 1084 ± 339 TRIMP). Average
weekly training volume was 15% lower in BP compared to
TRAD (Table 1, P = 0.001). Total annual training volume was
795 h distributed across 478 sessions in BP and 938 h over 538
sessions in TRAD. The average weekly ETL and volume across
the diﬀerent phases are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1A.
The average rank in international competitions in the two
investigated seasons was 4.2 ± 4.4 (2.9–5.6 in the ﬁrst and second
phase, respectively) in BP vs. 2.8 ± 5.8 (1.4– 5.8 in the ﬁrst and
second phase, respectively) in TRAD. Total annual days spent at
altitude were 58 and 54 during BP and TRAD, respectively. The
same number (36) of days without training were found in BP and
TRAD. The number of illness days was seven (one period in CP)
in BP compared to nine (one period in GP1, one period in GP2,
and one in CP) in TRAD.
Distribution of Training Forms and Exercise Modes
The training forms in BP were distributed as 746 h (94%)
endurance, 40 h (5%) strength, and 10 h (1%) speed training
compared to 836 h (89%) endurance, 86 h (9%) strength, and
15 h (2%) speed training in TRAD. Weekly endurance-training
volume was 11% lower in BP compared to TRAD (Table 1,
P = 0.019). The weekly strength training time was 54% lower in
BP vs. TRAD (Table 1, P < 0.001); this was present in all phases
except CP. No diﬀerence was found in maximal strength training
between BP and TRAD, but a much higher amount of general
strength training (48 vs. 0.4 h) was performed during TRAD. The
weekly speed training time was 37% lower in BP compared to
TRAD (Table 1, P = 0.023). The distribution of training forms
across phases is presented in Figure 1B.
The distribution of speciﬁc/non-speciﬁc exercise modes was
approximately similar (61/39%) in BP and TRAD. No diﬀerences
between the weekly amount of speciﬁc vs. non-speciﬁc training
were found across the annual phases, except for 65% higher
volume of non-speciﬁc exercise modes in CP during TRAD
(Table 1, P = 0.016).
Endurance Training
According to the time spent in each intensity zone, the
distribution of LIT/MIT/HIT was 88/1/11% in BP and 92/4/4%
in TRAD. Quantiﬁed in terms of the number of sessions, this was
61/3/36% in BP and 76/8/16% in TRAD.
The volume of LIT was 15% lower in BP than TRAD (Table 1,
P = 0.004). Further BP included 34% more LIT time performed as
warm up or cool down in connection with MIT, HIT, or strength
sessions (Table 1, P = 0.006), while 28% more of the LIT volume
in TRAD was performed as sessions >90 min (Table 1, P = 0.002).
The LIT time and sessions across the diﬀerent categories of
duration, in BP and TRAD are presented in Figure 1C.
A substantially lower number of MIT sessions was performed
in BP than TRAD (13 vs. 38 sessions). Accordingly, weekly MIT
time was 70% lower in BP than TRAD (Table 1, P < 0.001).
The annual number of HIT sessions was much higher during BP
(157 vs. 77 sessions), and weekly HIT time was 121% higher in
BP compared to TRAD (Table 1, P < 0.001). The progression
of MIT and HIT from GP1 to CP was diﬀerent between BP and
TRAD. While BP included high amounts of HIT already in the
beginning of the annual training cycle, followed by a reduction
toward CP, TRAD had a progressive increase of HIT toward CP.
The distribution of MIT and HIT time and sessions, across the
annual phases is presented in Figure 1D.

LIT, low-intensity training, heart rate <87% max; MIT, moderate-intensity training, heart rate 87–92% max; HIT, high-intensity training, heart rate >92% max. ∗MIT and HIT
sessions normally included 30–45 min of LIT as warm up and 15–30 min LIT as cool-down.
35.6 h HIT was performed during HIT blocks representing
45% of annual HIT volume. Weekly ETL during HIT blocks
was 1366 ± 68 TRIMP (Min-Max; 1254–1446 TRIMP). The
average time between HIT blocks was 27 ± 12 days (15–48 days).
The placement of HIT blocks and the weekly training content

Distribution of Training Forms and Intensity
Total training volume during HIT blocks was 16.2 ± 1.3 h/wk
performed across 10.8 ± 0.4 sessions/wk. This included
15.1 ± 1.1 h/wk (93%) endurance training and 1.1 ± 0.4 h/wk
(7%) strength training. Only 0.3 h of speed training was
performed
during
one
of
the
HIT
blocks.
Endurance
training time was distributed into 11.1 ± 1.4 h/wk LIT,
0.2 ± 0.3 h/wk MIT, and 3.8 ± 0.5 h/wk HIT, which gives
a

as 1.3 ± 1.0 LIT, 0.2 ± 0.3 MIT, and 7.7 ± 0.9 HIT,
which gives a session in zone distribution of 14/2/84%
LIT/MIT/HIT. The total number and duration of LIT, MIT,
and HIT sessions performed in BP and TRAD are presented
in Figures 3A,B.
Exercise Modes and Design of Sessions
The 75 HIT (73 sessions) and MIT (2 sessions) sessions
were distributed as 29% running, 17% running with poles,
as well as 8% double poling, 22% skating, and 24% classic
on snow or roller skiing. Eighty-seven percent of HIT
sessions were performed as intervals with working periods
of 4–7 min, 10% performed as continuous sessions and
3% performed as intervals < 4 min. The most typical
HIT session was 5 × 4 min, with 2–3 min recovery
between working periods (see typical examples of sessions
in Table 2).
The interviews revealed that the participant was very
deliberate when performing HIT sessions during HIT blocks.
This included a slow progression in workload allowing heart
rate (HR) to gradually reach the target HR zone (>92% of
HRmax), keeping the pace steady when target HR was reached.
A detailed description of the training performed in one high-load
week during TRAD compared to 7 days of one representative
HIT-block is presented in Table 2.
Training Between HIT Blocks
The average ETL between the HIT blocks was 1259, 1249,
and 1087 TRIMP/wk during GP1, GP2, and SP, respectively.
Total training volume was 20 h/wk during GP1-2 and
16 h/wk in SP, with the weekly average of HIT being ∼1 h
and ∼2 sessions. According to training time, the intensity
distribution of LIT/MIT/HIT was 93/1/6%, and this was
81/3/16% relative to the number of sessions. No HIT blocks were
performed in CP.
The average ETL during the 7 days after each HIT block
was 1198 TRIMP, with an average training volume of 19.7 h/wk
including ∼7 LIT sessions, 1–2 MIT/HIT sessions, and 1–2
strength sessions.

Block vs. Traditional Periodization of HIT
DISCUSSION
In this study, we compared the use of block and traditional
periodization of HIT, in two comparable successful seasons of
the world’s best XC skier and provided a detailed description of
macro, meso, and micro-organization of HIT blocks across an
annual cycle. Despite equal ETL in BP and TRAD, a signiﬁcantly
higher training volume was found in TRAD, mainly due to
longer duration of LIT sessions and more MIT. In contrast,
twice as many HIT-sessions were performed during BP. The
progression and distribution of HIT also diﬀered between the
2 years: TRAD included a progressive increase in HIT toward
CP, whereas BP included high amounts of HIT already in GP1,
followed by a reduction toward CP. During BP, the athlete
performed seven major HIT blocks, varying from 7 to 11 days
with each including 8–13 HIT sessions. This contrasts with
the organization of HIT in TRAD, in which only half the
number of HIT sessions were performed, evenly distributed as
1–3 session/wk.
Comparisons of Block and Traditional
Periodization of HIT
This is the ﬁrst study comparing successful utilization of block
and traditional periodization of HIT in a world-class endurance
athlete, where HIT blocks were used to signiﬁcantly increase the
amount of HIT. In this case the total ETL did not diﬀer between
the two investigated years, allowing for a valid comparison of
the athlete’s macro-, meso-, and micro-organization of training
volume, intensity distribution, content, as well as the design of
training sessions.
A higher endurance training volume was found in TRAD,
which
was
primarilly
explained
by
more
LIT
(∼15
vs.
13 h/wk) including longer duration LIT sessions (∼5 vs. 3
sessions/wk > 90 min). More frequent exposure to longer
duration LIT sessions in TRAD might have induced a positive
long-term physiological adaptation that has also been highlighted
in previous studies (Seiler, 2010). In BP, LIT was still a
large proportion of the overall endurance training volume,
but much of the LIT was performed as shorter bouts of
warm up or cool down in connection with HIT sessions.
Whether the total volume of LIT, independent of type of
sessions, vs. a high volume due to longer duration LIT-
sessions plays a role for the endurance adaptations is currently
not known. As a compensation for the lower amount of
LIT, as well as less MIT (13 vs. 38 sessions), in BP than
TRAD, substantially more HIT training was performed (157
vs. 77 sessions), resulting in similar ETL across these two
periodization models.
According to the time spent in each intensity zone, the
distribution of LIT/MIT/HIT time was 92/4/4% in TRAD
and 88/1/11% in BP, demonstrating a higher proportion of
HIT in BP than previously reported in XC skiers (Tønnessen
et al., 2014; Sandbakk et al., 2016; Sandbakk and Holmberg,
2017). Quantiﬁed in terms of the number of sessions, the
intensity distribution in BP is further distinguished from
TRAD and previous studies on XC skiing. In fact, the
number of sessions at each intensity level shows a polarized
distribution of 61/3/36% for LIT/MIT/HIT in BP. This number
of HIT sessions in combination with the large annual training
volume (∼800 h) is among the highest amount of HIT
ever reported for elite endurance athletes in the scientiﬁc
literature (Stöggl and Sperlich, 2015). This contrasts with the
session distribution of 76/8/16% LIT/MIT/HIT observed in
TRAD and diﬀers substantially from the 20% distribution of
HIT-sessions previously observed in elite endurance athletes
(Seiler, 2010).
The major portion of HIT sessions in BP were performed as
interval sessions with relatively short work duration (typically
5 × 4 min > 92% of HFmax), while more of the longer
duration MIT sessions (typically 5 × 7–8 min @ 87–92%) were
employed in TRAD. Physiological adaptations depend on both
intensity and accumulated duration of training. For example,
accumulating ∼30–45 min at ∼90% HRmax twice per week has
been found to be more eﬀective than accumulating 15–20 min
at ∼95% HRmax (Sandbakk et al., 2013; Seiler et al., 2013). This
indicates that, in our athlete who performed MIT sessions at
around 90% of HRmax, the eﬀects of the higher number of HIT
sessions in BP could have been compensated for by a higher
number of long-duration MIT sessions in TRAD.
We
found
opposite
patterns
in
the
distribution
and
progression of MIT and HIT across the phases of the
training year in the two periodization models. In BP, the
amount of HIT was already high in GP1 (1.9 h/wk) with
a small reduction in SP (1.7 h/wk) and a further reduction
in CP (1.3 h/wk). There was also a tendency for the
HIT blocks to become shorter with fewer HIT sessions
toward CP. In contrast, the amount of HIT was lowest
in GP1 (0.4 h/wk) in TRAD, then increased toward CP
(1.2 h/wk), whereas the amount of MIT showed the opposite
pattern. Thus, TRAD represents a gradual change to a more
polarized distribution with increased amounts of HIT closer
to the desired peak performance. This is consistent with
previous observations in world class XC skiers and orienteers
(Tønnessen et al., 2014, 2015).
The diﬀerent progression in HIT clearly represents diverse
training philosophies. Interviews with the participant and her
coaches indicate that the HIT blocks were aimed at enhancing
VO2max early in the preparation phase. This in order to facilitate
higher training velocities throughout GP and SP and thereby be
at a higher performance level as the CP approached. This is in
contrast to TRAD, in which high volumes of LIT during GP are
believed to provide an aerobic platform on which to build speciﬁc
adaptations in response to increased HIT and optimization of
performance toward CP (Laursen, 2010).
Despite clearly diﬀerent volumes and organization of HIT,
we found no diﬀerence in the performance development from
the ﬁrst to the second phase of the competition season
within BP compared to TRAD. However, a limitation of our
comparison of performance in BP vs. TRAD is that the
traditional model was utilized later in the athlete’s career, when
she was more experienced and that the competition program
in XC-skiing changed during the investigated period. Further
studies are therefore needed to investigate performance outcomes

preparation phases.
Detailed Description of the Use of HIT
Blocks in BP
The present study is the ﬁrst to give detailed insights into
successful use of HIT blocks across an annual cycle in a world
class endurance athlete. Of the 157 HIT sessions performed in BP,
73 sessions were organized during the HIT blocks, representing
∼45% of annual HIT volume and sessions. Speciﬁcally, seven HIT
blocks, with a duration of 7–11 days including 8–13 HIT sessions,
were performed from GP1 to SP. With such a high density of HIT
sessions, a challenge is the short recovery time and a subsequent
risk of accumulation of fatigue from sessions targeting the same
systems. This challenge was indeed the case for our participant,
where the average frequency of HIT sessions was ∼8 sessions over
a 7 days period, with 1–3 days that included two HIT sessions
performed on the same day. Although gradual fatigue over the
period was sometimes the case, interviews with the participant
indicate that she was mostly able to maintain a relatively high
training quality throughout the HIT blocks, including when two
HIT sessions were performed on the same day. In contrast, Yeo
et al. (2008) reported the power output produced by endurance-
trained athletes to be lower during a second session of HIT
performed on the same day compared to a separate day. Reduced
HR during maximal exercise has also been demonstrated in
competitive cyclists following a period of training predominantly
consisting of HIT (Jeukendrup et al., 1992). However, in the
study by McGawley et al. (2017), the authors found no diﬀerence
in either time in HR zones or distance covered resulting from
performing nine vs. three HIT sessions a week.
An important point in this context is that XC skiers
alternate between several exercise modes in their training.
During HIT blocks, the participant utilized ﬁve diﬀerent exercise
modes including speciﬁc (classic and skating technique on
skis or roller-skis), semi-speciﬁc (double poling or running
with poles), and non-speciﬁc (running) exercise modes. This
micro periodization of diﬀerent exercise modes, with diﬀerential
loading of the upper and lower body, is likely very important
in maintaining the quality of sessions as well as avoiding
muscular fatigue throughout the HIT blocks. Furthermore,
both the participant and her coaches reported that the
HIT sessions during blocks were closely supervised with a
focus on a progressive increase in speed from the start of
the sessions allowing HR to gradually approach the target
intensity zone without increasing the velocity further when
target HR (>92% of HRmax) was reached. Her coaches
stated that “after completing the last interval of a HIT
session, the athlete should potentially be able to perform one
additional interval at approximately the same pace.” This precise
steering of intensity is critical, and diﬀers from studies that
investigate HIT protocols when performing HIT sessions at
the maximum sustainable intensity during all interval bouts,
so-called “isoeﬀort” matching (Sylta et al., 2016). In the current
case, the precise steering of intensity during HIT sessions likely
contributed to a reduced recovery time, thereby increasing
the participant’s ability to perform the high frequency of
HIT sessions at high quality and tolerate the overall training
load during blocks.
Only a minor diﬀerence in the number of illness days or
periods was found between BP and TRAD in our study. However,
intensiﬁed training or frequent competitions have previously
been associated with negative changes in immunological variables
and more illness incidents (Tiollier et al., 2005; Papacosta and
Nassis, 2011; Li et al., 2012; Svendsen et al., 2015, 2016). Another
concern regarding the use of HIT blocks is the reduction in
well-being and increased stress levels (Jeukendrup et al., 1992;
Halson et al., 2002; Jurimae et al., 2004; Coutts et al., 2007).
Therefore, the high stress induced by HIT blocks might increase
the risk of long-term performance decline, overtraining, or
non-functional over-reaching when stress and recovery is not
suﬃciently balanced (Meeusen et al., 2013). To prevent this, our
participant had a reduction in training load after each HIT block
and clearly reduced the amount of HIT sessions between blocks.
We speculate that this was the main reason for the low number of
sickness days, as well as her high motivation for training in both
seasons analyzed.
The participant had progressively increased her training
load since junior level and was in a highly trained state
when she started the relatively extreme use of HIT blocks
presented here (Solli et al., 2017). This, as well as her
balanced micro-periodization of HIT blocks, made her able to
tolerate high loads of HIT, increasing her performance rapidly
during the ﬁrst 2–3 years utilizing this periodization model.
However, it should be noted that her performance stagnated
during the following years. In retrospect, both the participant
and her coaches agree that block periodization of HIT was
eﬀective during the ﬁrst seasons (2004–2006), but that they
subsequently should have changed the training to focus more
on maintaining the increased capacity and targeting other
performance-related factors. This coincides with the participant’s
next major performance improvement in 2010 (Solli et al.,
2017), including a change to a traditional model presented
in the current study. Therefore, it could be stated that block
periodization of HIT is eﬀective in inducing rapid performance
improvements but has some limitations and risks in respect to
long-term utilization.
Limitations
The main limitation of this study is that BP and TRAD were
carried out with almost 10 years between them, so that eﬀects
of training history might diﬀer between the two periodization
models examined for this speciﬁc athlete. Although the ETL
was similar in the two investigated years, diﬀerences in content,
intensity distribution, duration, and frequency of sessions clearly
diﬀered. When interpreting our results, it is hence important
to be aware of the integrated eﬀects of both inclusion of HIT
blocks and diﬀerences in overall training content. In addition,
the development of XC-skiing and changes in the competition
program makes it diﬃcult to directly compare the performance
development throughout the investigated years. Unfortunately,
no test data was available for BP that could have allowed more
detailed analyses of the development of performance indicators

Block vs. Traditional Periodization of HIT
throughout the annual cycle. Furthermore, the main focus in
this study was to compare the training organization and content
between BP and TRAD and other components important for
the training outcome such as physical characteristics, abilities,
mentality, lifestyle and nutrition are not discussed here. Still, this
study provides unique insights into how relatively extreme HIT
blocks are managed in a world-class athlete, and how this diﬀers
for the same athlete using a traditional model.
Practical Applications
This study shows that block periodization of HIT was successfully
utilized in a world class XC-skier. In particular, we highlight
the importance of balanced micro-periodization during HIT
blocks by utilizing diﬀerent exercise modes, careful steering
of intensity, and reductions in the training load and amount
of HIT after each block. In addition, the periodization model
must be adjusted to the athlete’s training status, and the risk of
negative over-reaching and stress on the immunological system
must be considered. However, the participant also achieved
substantial success using a traditional model, which might
be considered a “safer” model. We hope that our study can
highlight the importance of tailoring training to each individual
athlete based on training history and other factors inﬂuencing
adaptation to training.
CONCLUSION
This study provides novel insights into successful utilization of
two diﬀerent periodization models by the world-leading XC skier
of our time. Despite similar ETL, a higher training volume due to
more MIT and long duration LIT sessions was found in TRAD.
In contrast, twice as many HIT-sessions were performed in BP,
which is among the highest volumes of HIT ever reported for
elite endurance athletes. This high HIT volume was achieved by
organizing 45% of the annual HIT sessions across seven HIT
blocks, varying from 7 to 11 days, with each block including 8–13
HIT sessions. The progression and distribution of HIT diﬀered
clearly between periodization models: BP included high amounts
of HIT already from the ﬁrst preparation period, followed
by a reduction toward CP, while TRAD had a progressive
increase in HIT toward the CP. Altogether, this study illustrates
two successful ways of periodizing endurance training in a
world class athlete.
